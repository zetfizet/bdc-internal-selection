"In many countries, more and more young people are leaving school and unable to find job after graduation. What peoblem do you think youth unemployment will cause to the individual and society? Give reasons and make suggestion.","Unemployment in young generation is one of the major concerns in many nations, as schools are regularly producing scholars, but they are unable to earn bread and butter. There are various issues that have been caused by unemployment, which are described in upcoming fragments along with its solutions.
To embark with, there are numerous problems associated with the unavailability of jobs on personal as well as community level. Firstly, workless youngsters remains unoccupied for most of the time. Due to which, they get easily indulge in malpractices such as drugs, juvenile delinquency, cyber crime and many more. Apart from this, it inculcates discouragement among other brilliant students and they lack interest in academics.  Owing to it, even parents are not willing to send their kids to school. Thus, minimal working options are impacting individuals and society in a bad way. However, these issues are not insurmountable.
There are some remedial measures that can be taken to curb this issue. Initially, the Government should start some practical courses for free, so that students can get self-employed by running their individual professions such as mechanic, plumber, electrical engineer etc. Secondly, the more employment options can be generated by encouraging self-help groups, in which small manufacturing industries are initiated in homes, on the basis of various craftsmen skills. So, every citizen willing to work can get better opportunities.
To put in a nutshell, it can be said that although concerns related to lack of job opportunities are serious, but these can be solved easily by starting professional courses and encouraging self employment option. Hence, citizens should work in-tandem with high authorities to curtail this problem from the roots."
Some believe that people are naturally born leaders while others feel that leadership skills can develop. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"The pie chart illustrates the rates of destination of university graduate student in anthropology right after they are graduated, while the additional table compares the salaries of the three types of anthropologists employees who already worked for five years. 

Overall, the full-time worker became one of the biggest interest fields that the graduate anthropology student wanted to be involved, while the part-time work-post study became the lowest field of interest by the student. After five years of working, the government sector became the highest salary types of employment for an anthropologist. 

The full-time work field accounted for 52% of the anthropologist student in one university which is taking the biggest part of the destination for the anthropologist graduate student to start a carrier. Also, followed by part-time work at 15 %, unemployed at 12% and full-time postgraduate study and not known, which are 8% each. Likewise, the lowest field of destination for a fresh graduate student is part-time work and postgraduate study, which is only for 5% student in the whole university. 

Turning to, the salaries of anthropologist that worked for five years in freelance consulting accounted for 40 % for the amounts of  75,000-99,999 and 100,000 or more while the range of 25,000-49,999 only took 15 % of the employee and the range of 25,00-49,999 took the smallest rates of the employee, which is only for 5%. In the other hand, 50 % of the Government sector employee received 100,000 or more for the salaries, while only 5 % to get the range 25,000-49,999. Finally, the private company can afford 35% of their employee to getting 50,00-74,999 range of salary, while only 10% of them can get  50,00-74,999."
"Every day, millions of tons of food are wasted all over the world. Why do you think this is happening? And how can we solve this problem?","Each day tons of food is being wasted in many ways in the world.The major wastage is happening with teenagers because they don't know the importance of the food and the effects by wasting it.
Primarily,parent's are responsible for this immature behaviour.They don't teach their children the importance of food.As when they grow up they will join in the hostels and do the same thing there of course the teachers have the responsibility to look after them and advising them to not waste food,but students now a days are not obedient to listen after teacher.
Secondly,Events like marriage have the greater part in wasting food because they will cook the food to the maximum because in the middle of the marriage if the food get's completed then it will be status issue for them so they cook for the maximum.
The worst part is if the people haven't appeared for the wedding then the remaining food is all wasted.
In conclusion,it is healthy way to educate children to not waste food from the childhood and also it is important to cook only for the confirmed members."
some people think that the best way to solve global environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There can be little doubt that the only way to solve the world's environmental problems is to put fuel at a higher amount is a major concern in many societies in the world. This writer argues that there are many ways to feature cut rather than this because this can change the community's lifestyles and make a rush of the economy in many nations.

A crucial reason for the problem of making a difference in people's daily lives. This is due to the fact that the charge of living will increase directly and facing up with many taxes and bills. As a result, this makes society's life harder, and this leads to the food and drinks change, so many families need to save up and use fewer vehicles just for some important things to do. Therefore, it is advisable that increasing the charge of fuel brings many negative effects on the public's lives.

Many rushes from many countries are another point worth considering. It is vital to understand that governments will get in trouble with transportation, trading, education and especially for  food and drinks. Many businesses need to close down and have the intention of moving to something brand new owing to the non-profit of selling stuff. In this context, it is not difficult to understand why  this not making the environment better, just getting worse and will cause potential struggles.

Taking all points into account, transportation, price tag of living and all the stuff we need will make things not change much and this can encourage and give many opportunities for society to develop the country. As a consequence, this will bring fewer jobs to do and can solve the world's environmental problems easily, all things governments can do is  find a better way."
"Some people think the best way to solve global environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel. 

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","At one point in time, the government tried to solve global environmental problems by way of increasing the cost of diesel and petrol. While some people argue that it is an efficient way to solve environmental issues, I believe this effort is not the best solution for the environmental problem based on the following reasons.

Firstly, increasing fuel costs is not an efficient way to combat environmental pollution. This is because, by increasing the costs of fuel, people still be able to choose other means of transportations to travel such as trains and buses. It doesn’t deter or decrease the use of transportation which ultimately will still contribute to pollution. 

On the other hand, there are other ways that can contribute to resolving the issues. One of the solutions is to increase taxes for oil and gas companies for drilling oil. With the increment of taxes, it will leave the company with no choice but to shut down drilling projects and stop any oil productions. Secondly, the government can work on providing incentives for the companies who contribute to renewable resources spending.  By providing the incentives on the company annual spending, the company will start exploring other options such as renewable or waste-based energy. 

For instance, organisation like Woodside has started to move away from oil and gas drilling to renewable energy and resources projects after the Australian Government announced the incentive for companies who promote renewable resources spending. 

In conclusion, I reiterate my statement above and disagree that increasing oil prices is the best solution to solve environmental issues. I believe there are other alternatives such as increasing taxes for oil productions and giving out incentives for renewable energy and resources to deal with the issues."
Some people think that the best way to solve global environment problems is to increase the cost of fuel. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some individuals believe that the better method to tackle environmental issues is to rise  the price of petrol. I totally disagree with this statement, and I woulid like to recommend some possible measures in order to improve this situation.

To being with, there are serveral reasons why I believe that growing the cost of fuel is not the perfect solution. Firstly, increase the price of fuel can have a negative impact in people live and make the problem worsen. This because some people live in rural area or cities have poor  of infrastructure namely, public transport , which means  people do not have alternative than using vehicles. Secondly, increase the cost of petrol can contributes to go up of the cost of basic needs such as, food, goods, clothes, this because transfer these products via cars and trucks which uesd fuel. Therefore, increase the gap between wealthy and poor people , and also increase the poverty and encourage people to commit crime in order to meet their familiies responsibilities.   

Regarding of alternative solutions to this issue , I think the government can make a huge difference by adopating some steps. The first meausre the authouirties can make  improvement in public transport system such as, buses, subways, railways to make it more convenient and faster to motivate people to utilize it. Second measure, incentivize the companies ,schools, and university to allows students and employees to work or study from home. Thus, these steps can assist to reduce the number of cars on the roads as well as CO2 footprint , also mitigat climate change and global warming. 

In conclusion, it seems to me that increase the cost of fuel is not good solution and I suggested effective methods to deal with environmental problems."
"Some people think that the best way to solve global environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel.


To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Our mother Earth is currently facing a lot of environmental concerns. Some people believe that by increasing the fee of fuel we would be able to resolve these issues. In my opinion, it may help to some extant, however,this is not the only solution to clear up this problem.To begin with, people from driving their cars release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere which is detrimental to the environment.That is, increasing the price of has can help make people run their own vehicles less often and this change forms the air much cleaner.However, this turn will not stop environmental concerns. Moreover, hiking the price of the fuel will affect weak and middle class family.Yet, another compelling reason against the statement is that, people can handle and lessen environmental problems by some better quick fixes. A good illustration of this is, using renewable sources instead of non-renewable resources would be an appropriate way. For example, solar power is an efficient substitute for gasoline.Furthermore, improving public transportation and encourage people to use them is another practical solution.To put it differently, the capture attraction of people to travel by bus or train.For instance, encourage people to adopt public transportation by decreasing the cost of tickets.Not only will it eliminate air pollution, but it also helps to reduce traffic jam.To conclude, considering the points discussed above, the most rational conclusion to be drawn is that, the hike in the petrol price is not the best solution to this problem. Investing in renewable energy sources and improving the efficiency of public transport is a better alternative that ought to be considered."
Some people find advertisement amusing or annoying and they are not influenced by this when they shop. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"A substantial proportion of individuals tend towards the viewpoint that they are always annoyed and distracted by means of online advertisements and this does not help them to fulfil their shopping demands. I strongly agree with this notion and this essay will shed light on belief supplements with my own perspective.

Considering firstly the disadvantages of online advertisements for individuals, one factor must be mentioned is  time-wasting. Some people find it really annoying to spend time waiting for online adverts while surfing the internet. This argument rests on the idea that commercial videos sometimes prevent people from enjoying the whole movie or song. Besides,  repeated playback sometimes puts people in a bad mood and affects their experience since they have to see it several times. These letters are considered  drawbacks of adverts since it put a negative impact on people’s entertainment experience.

To elaborate on why some individuals tend not to choose items in advertised videos when they shop, there are some culprits. Firstly, it is believed that the more businesses spend on promoting products, the higher the goods’ costs will be. That phenomenon is unaffordable for some buyers. Furthermore, it is proven that not wholehearted products in commercial clips are reliable for instance the wrong products which are not as described. For that reason, some buyers are not influenced by this way of promoting goods.

In a nutshell, I strongly support the view that commercial videos are sometimes so annoying and distractive that they can affect crowds’ experience as well as they do not have the ability to influence all buyers."
Films and computers games containing violence are popular. Some people say they have negative effect on society and should be banned. Others say they are just harmless relaxation. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"In this century many teenagers like playing video or online games that contain violence, parents and people believe that it can have a bad effect and make them angry, and some say that films also make them  less patient and be less nicer I will discuss further in this essay about this topic.

First, right now more than half of the them have violence and killing so society thinks that it can affect young children, but not only do these have an age rate but they also decrease stress. Video games help many people with their anxiety and stress relief for example in workplaces where society has  room to rest and play, they will be more influenced because sometimes they forget how strong they are. Movies also can have a bad and a good effect it only depends on how the public sees the movie if you see it with a bad mindset even the nicest film in the world will have a bad impression on you.

Secondly, in many cases they really have a bad influence on children and teenagers and make them angrier, it happens when they are not ready to understand that  life in society is different from playing a game and they believe that they are mixed not separate, therefor they become harmful for the public around them. I think that it depends on the parents which is good for your child to play it or not.

To conclude, video games may have a bad effect on young adults but we should consider other options that can be a push for doing harmful activities like  the environments they are living in or the public they communicate with, but this subject needs more investigation in the future."
Some people think advertisements may have positive economic effects whereas others think there are negative social effects because individuals are not satisfied with who they are and what they have. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"A number of people give their opinion that marketing brings positive economic influences, at the same time, another group of people think it exerts negative social impacts because not everyone is happy with their position and what they have. In this case, I think, it has some good effects on economical growth because advertisment helps to grab customers attention that can be a good reason of making a good profit and on the other hand, people may get depressed to see the product because they do not have it. Moreover, this essay explores the both sides of advertisment.

To begin with, in terms of attracting customers interest, advertisements play a significant role. Furthermore, if a person gets to know about a product, she will buy it to try and that assists a company to make a good income. For example, I use skincare products. If I get in touch with a new one through advertisment, I will definitely buy it.

Secondly, if we discuss about the bad effects, people's depression is one of them. after seeing a advertisment, an individual may have desire to have the thing that they are showing. It make them feel insufficient and  that lead them to depression. For instance, my cousin had a cycle but after knowing the updated one is arrived, it ignites his ambition. as a result, he ended up getting sad and depressed due to his lack of money to buy it.

Therefore, from my perspective, I think, it  mostly offers a positive effect since people are being able to know about the new goods in the market, and also they are purchasing them that contributes to make a very good profit. Additionally, it also enhances the economical condition of a country.

To conclude, as I mentioned, both facts are true in a sense such as advertisment is a great way to get buyers which is good and the bad effect is people feel incomplete with what they have. In my opinion, the positive effect is more stronger as it expands the economical growth."
"Nowadays, we are surround by advertising in our daily lives. Some people believe this has a positive effect on society. WOthers, however, say that it is a negative development. Discuss with both views and give your own opinion.","It is discussed by a part of society that  surrounded by commercials have positive effect on people, another group of people oppose and consider that it is a negative growth. I will discuss both sides in this essay below.

Nowadays, when consumers want to buy an item or service, it's very easy to access of information about that. Commercials are one of the most important way access to information. By advertising, consumers can readily learn features of items or devices which they want to purchase and also it is easy to compare , therefore consumers can buy right items which they need. For example,it is very easy to compare two mobile phones brand by their commercials.  In additionaly, by growing of commercial sector, unemployment will decrease and people can find more job opportunities. Hence, this development will provide economic growth. 

On the other hand, surrounded by advertising in our lives provide that unneccessary shopping. 

When people see the commercials, they affect of them and can purchase some items which they don't actually need. Therefore, consumption frenzy is occurring. Advertising often promotes consumerism and materialism. People spend their money unnecessarily and their budgets are damaged. Moreover, advertising has negative effects on kids. They can easily access to ads by growing of technology and want to buy anything what they see. My opinion is, advertising sector is informative but it should be restrict and audit by government. Some commercials can be wrong and fraud society. 

In conclusion, each particular idea has its own benefits and drawbacks but advertising sector is growing day by day."
"Films and computers games containing violence are popular. Some people say they have negative effect on society and should be banned. Others say they are just harmless relaxation. 

Discuss both views and give your opinion.","In this modern era, with the advancement of technology people have abilities to make various kinds of movies and video games. The subject of a lot of these films are contained violence, which have many fans between humans. While a group of people believe they have many negative impacts on families, and banning them is better. Others think they just can disturb humans’ relaxing time. In this essay, I will discuss these opposing attitudes and give my own opinion.

Regarding second view, lots of people watch these movies and play these games in their spare time, which is really satisfying for them. They could be like a hobby for them, and give them sense of excitement. In other words, this genre is their favorite object. In addition, some of these movies teach them how they can behave in the same situation, if they are in a horrifying circumstance, for example, when someone wants to steal their smartphones even themselves, moreover, they realize, what is real life, in fact life does not always treat them kindly, and friendly.

Turning to possible problems, these different movies and computer might increase disturbance between youngsters even adults, and may lead to some battles. To put it differently, juveniles may use these behaviors in their personal lives. Additionally, children might imitate these kinds of violence without understanding, and it could have a lot of negative effects on their future lives. Personally, I disagree with the banning of these games and shows, due to society have the power to choose, which that they should see, and which not. For instance, they can limit their children, so that they do not see.

In conclusion, it seems to me, that it would be wrong to ban these entertainments, and it is necessary for families to set some rules about watching and playing these films, and games."
"Some people think that competitive sports have a positive effect on the education of teenagers while others argue that the effect is negative.

Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","Athletic competitions are perceived to be educative to adolescents by some but others debate the are solely disadvantageous. On one hand , teenagers are challenged to develop their skills only in these situations and on the other hand, they begin to grow seeds of jealousy and rivalry. I think it causes more misunderstandings among team mates.

It can help team mates nurture their individual skills by playing in the midst of one another because at this age, most of them learn better in the company of their mates. A pubertal boy or girl who loses a game will put in more effort to do better in their next challenge and this follows an upward trend of growth and development in their education of the importance of outdoor activities. For instance, my nephew who is used to showing off his football skills, only started intensifying his training when he lost his first match.

The declaration of one person as the winner and the other the loser in an organised game could begin to make colleagues see each other as rivals, who are solely after the downfall of  each other. The problem is in these settings where people are considered competitors, teenagers are put under pressure so they begin to focus on showing off and outshining the other or in winning and gaining recognition and not in the level of training and experience they can gather from the second person. For example, my niece slowly started wishing for her friend to stop showing up in practice because when she was around, this meant she will not score more points in volleyball.

I think there are more disagreements and it takes away from the importance of sports and makes us focus on unnecessary things that can foster disunity. There are many terms that ought to be met in every sporting activity and a competition draws attention to these trivial issues allbecause one person wants to succeed and not the other. An example is how often the winning team is considered a cheat and how the losing team is seen to be the victim of such unfairness.

In conclusion, while the improved performace of any athletic teenager will depend on the number of competitions they have been a part of, it could also breed hatred and contempt. I think there will be more quarrels in such situations."
Some people think that robots are important for humankind's future development. Others think that robots have negative effects on society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"In this age of technocracy, among many wonderous inventions, robots have proven to be the most promising of them all. Many deem it to be a worthy addition to our lives, but contrarians to this notion believe that, it can prove detrimental to our society. In this essay, I will ruminate on both sides, before making my statement.

Those  who consider robotics to be vital for the advancement of civilization, do so by observing several quality-of-life changes brought by it. Such as, the integration of rudimentary assembly line machines used for product manufacturing. Moreover, there exist self-driving cars, waiting to revolutionize methods of transportation. Additionally, there have been major strides in the development of life-like androids. All in all, the future seems bright indeed according to these supporters.

However, trepidatious ones vouching against this technological progress, do so by witnessing drawbacks brought by these gizmos. Like, mass lay-offs caused by the introduction of automatic tools in many factories around the world. Furthermore, these people do not look favourably at the idea of automation in vehicles, as they are wary of hazards associated with it. Also, they hold fast to the belief that, there will come a day when automatons will completely render human talent superficial. As an example, the advent of artificial intelligence art (AI art) has filled artists around the globe with dread, as they think that they will soon be replaced by their man-made counterparts.

To conclude, In my opinion, both views of this argument possess merit. Thus, to ensure a better tomorrow, moderation must be made in terms of the development of bots."
The range of technology available to people is increasing the gap between the rich and the poor. Others think it has the opposite effect. Discuss both views and give your opinions.,"The development of technological devices has an in-deep impacts in our modern life. This is believed to be widen the disparity between the weathy and the poor, whereas others think is against. I also agree with those who consider that this gap is the causes of technology.

Granted, there are powerful reasons to make life more convinient and fulfilled for those who own the electronic equipment. Firstly, the lastest invention like smart phone encourages people who can catch up with the information via internet or Wi-fi. For instance, the director or the blue-color worker have been the same way to check daily duties througout the email or social networks such as Zalo or Twitter. Another reason is that the internet which is widely free in public departures to create people to broaden knowledge whenever they set up. Both students who raised in the less conditional family as well as the rich kids can register the online course with the reasonable fee.

On the other hand, I also believe that the drawbacks of these innovations in the specific fields. Obviously, it can be seen in medical treatment which has the high-cost expenduture in the same decease like cancer or hopeless case. Therefore, the people who can afford the hospital fees may have been cured with the expensive drug and costly caretakes. In contrast, the people without money, who worry about the need for day-to-day life cost, how can they pick up their mind about these issues. The other problem is that these devices are producted by many brands with a plenty of prices from low to high. Its qualities are associated with its cost. For example, BMW car which is compared with KIA Morning car, that is not pratical. 

In summary, I would argue that the advantages of this improvement, although this can brigde the gap between the rich folk and the poor. However, that can lead to the wide distance in community because of this frequency separation in each products."
"5.6. Some people think that robots are very important for humans' future development. Others, however, think that robots are a dangerous invention that could have negative effects on society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Many difficult and heavy tasks are almost done by robots in many different jobs such as IT, manufacturing or even driving. Robots are believed to be very important for humans in the future. However, the opposite claim that the existence of robots can bring negative effects on society.

The development of humans can not dismiss the huge benefit of robot invention. First and foremost, high-advanced technology saves an incredible amount of time and effort for us to do many things. A washing machine, for example, only needs to be set up at the start and after that, we have no need to do anything until the washing is done. What’s more, robots are now fully installed in many industries like cars, medicine, coke or food,... so the speed, accuracy and safety are absolutely ensured and it can be a good signal to the economy. Rising  production and a decrease in spending are two of the most important conditions that can provide the motivation for many companies to develop.

However, the fear of the bad effects of robots is completely well-founded. We rely too much on the artificial intelligence of robots that we are not able to do some very easy work. Moreover, many people are not ready for bad circumstances such as when robots are broken or when electricity is cut and robots can not run. On the other hand, the increasing installation of robots is the cause of the downturn of the labour market. Many workers have been altered by a lot of technological facilities and it is a really big problem that many governments have to concern about.

In conclusion, we are now living in a century in that artificial intelligence and robots become common. And although many advantages have been brought since the first time robots were invented,  they also bring some disadvantages to society."
"SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT PURCHADING OMPORTES ARGRICULTURAL PRODICTS HAS A POSITIVE EFFECT. Others think consuming domestic products is better. 

Dicuss both these views ang give your own opinion.","There are differing opinions regarding consuming agricultural products or buying products planted in our country. To content the food demand, it is necessary to deliver food abroad. However, from my perspective, I prefer to consume domestic foods to support local farmers.

 

On the one hand, Taiwan is an intense island with limited resources. People would like to exert each land’s value. To make the world operates more efficiently then importing is essential. For instance, Taiwan imported numerous economic crops from America due to mechanical farming methods are much cheaper than Taiwan. Regarding worldwide, the same products which make the less consumption of natural resources are more environmentally friendly. In this concern, shipments of agriculture and trading products foster eco-friendly.

 

Nevertheless, the complex economic system is not only for efficiency but also for employment rates. Concerned with the entire worldwide operation, if people solely consume aboard products, it could cause abundant farmers to lose their jobs. Furthermore, recently the farmland decreased and was substituted into factories. It could lead to other environmental issues such as air pollution and decreased species diversity. With the healthy awareness arousing, citizens prefer to purchase local products than imported foods, which even are more expensive. People care about the food’s quality and it can reduce transportation distances. Besides, accelerating local district economic growth can make the country's system operation more stable and also could enhance social bonding.

 

In conclusion, it is still essential to import agricultural products that Taiwan’s weather is not suitable for. However, consuming local products can make people more healthy and improve job opportunities."
"some people think that giving aid to poor countries has positive effect, while others believe that international aid should be stopped. Discuss both these view and give your own opinion","Looking at the task below, which is concerning the poverty of some states, it's evident the way in which two wide opinions try to prevail over each other, giving the opportunity to think and admit a personal idea, after having made a comparison and clear sentence, considering the positive and negative sides.

To begin with, the first view, which is related to the positivity of the factor, or rather, the genuine action, which many individuals adopt every day, towards many needy countries; The consequences are bringing success, happiness, and last but not least, peace and love, that should be present in any country. Nowadays, for instance, in several nations of the world such as Italy or Africa del Sud,  poverty is still the dominant phenomenon through families are keeping lose their family members, the sense of  life and what means love for  life and for the future. This is the reason why facilitated people are trying to help, as much they can, fortuneless mind kind,making sure with all their willpower an equal lifestyle for everyone. 

Following , the second view that proposes the negative side of  aid for  poor countries, the reasons can be many, and here is why it's dominant to highlight and understand the circumstances and motivations of why, nowadays, people still feel contempt and hatred against the unluckiest. One of the reasons, why units vary in wide groups of people is Racism. Due to this factor, many citizens, continue to see minorities in the direction of the other, creating  indifference for them. Consequently, lots of countries continue to suffer.

In my view, and personal experience, I strongly and absolutely concur with the idea that helping others is the most humane action that we can do, as tomorrow we could be the ones in need; And also because  positivity sows the future.

To sum up, with what has already been compared, analysed and discussed, it's important to highlight the importance and the beauty of changing what doesn't work around  us, trying to create a better world tomorrow."
Some people think that the range of technology currently available is increasing the gap between rich people and poor people. Others think that it is causing the opposite effect. Discuss both views,"In this era of globalisation, some individuals believe that due to wide range of technology available today, the gap between upper classes and lower classes increase significantly while others reject this notion. In my opinion, technology developments does not effect the gap among society, because its accessible by everybody. This essay will further elaborate on both views and thus lead to a logical conclusion.

To begin with, there are several reasons why one could think an increasing gap between rich and poor. One of the common reason is automation. Automation indeed play an important role in dealing with day to day of human's issues. However, automation reduces the need for manual labor in which people are no longer depending on each other. For instance, the implementation of artificial intelligence on cars creates unemployment and degrading the numbers of cars produced in the factory.Thus, there are no job opportunities for poor people.

On the other hand, some people believe that this wasn't the case. Due to advances in technology, numerous research on new substance can be done to support the society as a whole. For example, an increasing in technology lead to a better quality of medicine produced which in return help society who dealing with illness such as fever, cough and athsma. Moreover, another impact of technology is it improves food production where every party can benefit from it.

In the nutshell,  I strongly believe that technology could possibly narrow the differences social classes by increasing the quality of medicine and also enhances food indsutries."
Some people believe that climate change has the greatest effect on people’s way of life. Others believe the economy of the region has the greatest effect. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"It is argued that people's lifestyle has greatly affected by the climate, while other believe that it is the economy of nation that impact human's life the most. In my opinion, climate change is a biggest concern due to their harmful impact on people's health.

To commence with, there is no doubt that climate change is a biggest threat facing humanity. Climate impacts are already harming health through pollution, diseases and extreme weather events. In other words, nowadays people are dealing with many detrimental problems such as respiratory and cardivascular disease which leads a life threat for an individual. As a result, not only the medical expenditure has increased but also they might be dependent on medicines throughout the whole life. Moreover, due to climate change hunger and poor nutrition food has risen. Crops may be destroyed or become less productive because of increase in extreme weather events. Thus, people might not be grow sufficient food.

On the other hand, economy of the territory is the most important factor in citizens life because if an economy grows, the employment opportunities have also increased resulting in they get a chance to live in a better conditions. In addition to that, one can also manage to build a suitable lifestyle not only for themselves, but for their family members as well. Secondly, nation's economy alows better facilities to the public such as good education, hospitality sector. Therefore, if economy would not grow, people experience poverty and unemployment.

In conclusion, it is undeniable that the economy of a region has a great impact on the mankind, i believe that climate is a biggest threat to all the humanity due to their extreme effects on health and less availabilty of food."
Human activities have led negative effects on plants and animals all over the world. Some people think it is too late to do something about it. Others think there is still some time to take actions.   Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Extinction of different type of fauna and flora is often considered as the most urgent  environmental problems that we have to deal with nowadays. Although, some people could be  disagree because there are more pressing with other things. I totally agree that extinction of  species is a very serious problem, but also I believe that global warming is a more crucial  situation that we have to deal with.  On one hand, the disappearance of some species has been increasing over the years as a result  from human activities, such as deforestation or also illegal hunting. This is a big problem for  some countries because these species have a cultural significance. Moreover, the  disappearance of the species will be follow of the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem.  On the other hand, I have been Reading and listening about this problem. Recently, global  warming for example, which is described with increasing amount of carbon monoxide in the  atmosphere and the result will be increase of temperature and sea levels. Pollution is also  increasing and is one of the biggest problem around the world because the poor air quality has  harmful effects on human health, particularly in respiratory system and cardiovascular system.  Also, can be damage plants and animals like us.  To sum up, I am totally agree that the extinction of species must be prioritized. However, the  experts believe that is most important the temperature and sea levels. Furthermore, humans  we have to save the environment and help them to have more control about it, otherwise it  will be even worse."
"Movies and computer games containing violence are popular. Some people say they have a negative effect on society and should be censored. Others say they are just harmless relaxation.
Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","In the midst of this technology-driven global world, multimedia is widespread among the present generation, both adults and children. While films and video games are informative and mind-relaxing to some, many convey violence-containing content, that needs to be unpublished in the opinion of a part of the public. This essay will discuss both these views and I will give my opinion by the end.

First and foremost, in this busy society, people find hardly any time to spend in front of the tv and computers. They are more or less mind refreshing after a long stressful work. For example, many people like to listen to music,  watch favourite movies or play games to soothe their mind and relax their body. These stress relievers help to balance a person's overall mental stability.

Secondly, most programmes contain scenes of abuse, and cruelty, without which they might be incomplete. In the present, the crime rates are more when compared to the past. This can be co-related with the influence of inappropriate programme content that adults or children look into. For example, suicide is a common factor seen among  school-going children nowadays. For instance, there are very few who are not educated, hence they can differentiate between good and bad. Even after many scan proofing, these contents may adversely after the upcoming community.

To conclude, in my opinion, media which is more informative with less violent shows should be encouraged for a better future for people of all age groups."
Some believe that people should make efforts to fight climate change while others think it is better to learn to live with it. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"While certain individuals believe that modern society should increase the work towards saving our environment, others hold the view that it is better to accept the current situation. This essay will discuss both  opinions and explain why I think that the fight against climate change is inevitable.

Some people opine that macro-environmental forces are uncontrollable. As such, it is better to exploit  natural resources to their fullest. This spurs from a profit-making mindset and the failure to understand that large-scale calamities are not always caused by naturally occurring phenomena. To illustrate, some government officials have recently been found giving official statements about their support to critical large industrial corporations and asking local communities to accept the pain of moving their houses for a larger gain.

Conversely, most citizens find it essential to understand that climate change is our making to a very significant extent. This is because our modern lifestyle, in the process of providing us with modern amenities, has given up  regard for the very ecological system we exist in. For example, CO2 emission, a major factor in global warming, is found by various research studies to be the result of human transportation and energy needs. Therefore, until  better ways to fulfill these requirements are practically implemented, our ecosystem will keep being impacted adversely.

To conclude, although few people argue for the acceptance of the status quo, the majority of the population realizes the harmful effects of such an action. In my opinion, if the unfortunate effects of this situation are ignored, it will keep worsening and become irreversible, if it has not already."
some people believe that experience children have before they go to school will have the greatest effect. other argue that experience is gained when they are teenage have a big influence discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Many folks are of the opinion that infants and toddlers gain experiences that are superior to those experienced by teenagers. Neither one of these milestones in a juvenile’s soul trumps the other and both age groups learn valuable lessons during these years.

Firstly, there is much to be said about the first thousand days of an infant’s growth. Conversely, this is the period where they first become aware of their surroundings and the people that form part of their world. For example, they learn social skills, become aware of their bodies and the way it moves and they form attachments with their caregivers. Furthermore, they learn to trust, love, and express themselves as well as behaviours that will remain with them throughout life.

On the other hand, there are those who believe that minors are influenced by a greater audience and no longer primarily by their parents. Therefore, they are more exposed to the bigger world from which they can take experiences that will form them as adults. For example, as an infant their choices were what to watch on television or what to eat for supper but, as adolescents, these choices have turned into whether they should do the “right” thing or not. Above all, they have learned right from wrong and now they have the opportunity to apply what they learned as a young child.

In conclusion, juveniles will learn from and take experiences throughout the growth journey. In my opinion, both babies and teens will gain understanding wisdom as they reach certain milestones in their lives and neither age group is superior to the other with regards to them obtaining maturity."
Some people say that advertising has positive economic effects. Others think it has negative social effects because it will make people feel dissatisfied with who they are and what they have. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Nowadays, advertisements have been around us in many aspects of our life. There have been disputes as to whether it would have positive effects on our economy or negative ones on our society. In my opinion, advertising is a two-edged sword so we should make consideration before taking action.

Some think that promoting can increase sales of products. A good sales volume is sure to increase the profits of factories. Meanwhile, the selling and purchasing process can enhance the flow of products and money, which is also good for the local economy. However, the cost of advertising now is relatively high due to fierce competition. Too many advertisements would account for a great budget for manufacturers. If they cannot gain a good sale, this may lead them to bankrupt. 

Others state that advertising would have negative effects on our society. This would make us feel inferior. For example, over-promoting ancient drawings of galleys with everyone more than 1 million would let us know that all our assets cannot afford a piece of ancient drawing. This may beat down our confidence. But, this may also have positive effects. For those with high self-motivation, after they know this truth, they may spare no effort to strive to have a better life. As this spirit, it should be encouraged. 

In conclusion, advertising may bring both positive and negative effects on our society and economy. As to manufacturers, before we plan to promote our products, we should take concrete consideration. As to our society, we should establish a monitoring system to encourage those who really need advertisements and bit those who would cause negative competition."
"Some people believe that celebrities have a positive effect on society, while others think that their effect is harmful and negative. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","In the contemporary epoch, whilst opponents hold the view that influencers have detrimental effects on society, proponents have a diverse perspective. However, I am a staunch believer that these well-known characters have their own touch in pervading moral and appropriate doings. In this essay both perspectives along with my opinion will be further explained.

On the one hand, a category of individuals in the belief that singers, actors, and some public figures have a negative effect on adolescents and they do not have any salient role in the community compared to other vocations. In other words, if teachers who rear zillions of generations or engineers who explore new technologies every day for the environment safety are followed and imitated by youth, they help their society more than any other entertainer can do. An eminent example is the Egyptian actor “Mohamed Ramadan” who keeps presenting unprofessional content such as violent movies that pervades immoral concepts in society. Thus, what can be said is that not all influencers deserve to be praised as they negatively affect youth's way of thinking.

On the other hand, some celebrities are worthy of appreciation as they have an indispensable role. To illustrate more, some characters who constructively affect the community by their well doings such as donating to hospitals or participating in awareness campaigns, they deserve to be role models for most youngsters. For example, The Egyptian footballer  “Mohamed salah” who encouraged a plethora of young people to be involved in anti-drug campaigns. Therefore, not only do these luminaries deserve massive refunds, but also they deserve to be rewarded by the governments.

In conclusion, after this essay has manifested the above-mentioned points, it can be reiterated that some influencers inspire and admonish youth from crooked directions. I am convinced that those qualified public figures are worthy of being well-paid."
"Some people think that families have the most powerful influence on a child’s development, while others think other factors such as television, friend, music. etc. gave biggest effects. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Some people argue that family plays a crucial role in children's development. Others believe that television, books, etc., are the factors that can affect a child's growth. This essay will discuss these both views and argue in the favour of the prior.

On the one hand, When children watch their favorite comic character, they tend to imitate that character. Moreover, the reading of books can also influence the child's development internally. Along with that, the nature of the friends with which they are roaming is also very important that can play a vital role in the development of a child. For instance, children can follow and try to enact their favorite comic character.

On the other hand, Family is a pillar in a child's development journey. From the birth of a child, when they were in adolescence they learn qualities of their parents or family. When they habituated to bad habits.Furthermore, parents are always present in their life particularly at this stage.For example,children who are from broken familes they have high chance to exhibit delusional behaviour.

An emotionally safe and secure surroundings are also important for children.Additionally, Parents also teaches  children about setting boundaries.

In my opinion,children's choice of books,music, or friends depends on the values instilles in them by their parents.Therefor, parents hold more substantial sway over their offspring than media, pop culture and friends circle.

In conclusion, the outside world influences the intellectual and social development of children.However, I believe that it is parents who set the stage for these developments by laying a strong foundation from a very young age."
"Children today have more responsibilities than the past. Some people think it has positive effects than negative ones, while others disagree. Discuss both views, and give your own opinion.","Nowadays, most young people work tirelessly to accomplish certain goals. Certain individuals opine that this has bad attributes compared to good ones whereas some oppose this idea. I, however, think that duties given to children yield good results than bad. The essay below will discuss both views at length.

First and foremost, children need to be groomed for any life opportunities and uncertainties. Parents, relatives and even guardians do not live internally, for this reason, it is a great idea to give adolescents more work to do as a way of training them for the future.  Besides, nowadays most adults are in the diaspora searching for greener pastures. Thus children are left living by themselves with no adult supervision. For example, a study in Ghana showed that about thirty-two per cent of the child-headed families were responsible and able to fend for themselves because their deceased parents had taught them the survival skills. Therefore,  I agree that more responsibilities should be given to the youth as it may have a positive impact in the future.

On the other hand,  some people think that giving more duties to children has negative effects. They mention that too much work will disturb their progress at school. I think this view is invalid because studying does not mean someone should not do other chores. For example, it was proved by Stanley Lee in his book ,"" Dustless child"" that many learned youths are unable to do house chores. He puts the blame on parents who were reluctant to teach them essential responsibilities such as washing and cooking. Thus, I support the idea that more duties should be given to young people as it might benefit them in life.

In conclusion, I agree that children should be given more work to do as it may help them in the future although others think this will have a negative impact on their studies. These and other issues have been discussed in the above essay."
"Some believe that people should make efforts to fight climate change while others think it is better to learn to live with it.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","I disagree with people’s opinion that we need to find a way to live with climate change than prevent it. Even though people may think that change is inevitable, in my opinion, I think it is better to find ways to prevent the change than live with it. In this essay, I will share  my knowledge on how and why we can. 

Prevention is better than cure. As the good old saying goes, we would be better off preventing  climate change than trying to find a way to live with it. Living with the changes can impact our lives more negatively. We would also be able to use lesser resources to prevent a problem than to remedy it. For example, in the case of global warming, our governments could take a stronger step by imposing a ban or higher taxes on older gasoline vehicles and promoting electrical vehicles, bicycles or public transportation as an alternative option for their citizens. 

Save for our future generations. Another important reason to prevent  climate change is so that generations who come after us, get to enjoy the climate as we have seen and experienced it versus being forced to live with the changing world. It is our responsibility as humans to conserve, protect and prevent the changes. For example, when I was a kid, I could easily look up at the sky and gaze at the stars in the sky without the need for a telescope. Nowadays, it is very difficult to find starts with just naked eyes. If this persists, our future generations may never even know that starts to exist as they never are able to see it themselves.

Summarizing this essay, we would work to prevent a change than  live with it. Prevention will not only prevent the spread of change but at the same time will help us to leave behind a better future for the generations who come after us."
Some people think that robots are important for human’s future development. Others think that robots have negative effects on society.  Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Robots now play a vital role in people's lives, thanks to advances in science and technology. Some people believe that robots have harmful impacts on society. However, robots, in my opinion, are more on the side of liberating humanity from monotonous jobs and unleashing our creativity.

People have negative thinking about robots for a variety of reasons. First, it must be mentioned that automation could eliminate jobs that can be done by robots instead. So that, a large scale of unemployment could happen. Additionally, investment in the robotics field makes the budget for other important areas limited such as healthcare, scientific research. Furthermore, mechanization has deskilled many workers which could delete some specific jobs. For example, the baristas become less valued at work by virtue of being replaced by coffee machines.

Besides these above human concerns, the vision of a new modern world where humans will take the role of creators, and artificial intelligence will create machines to realize those creations. One of the benefits that robots bring to people's lives is that they are programmed to perform tasks with high precision such as performing surgeries. Plus, they can increase proficiency at work thanks to higher speed and consistency. For instance, instead of using one hundred employees working in a production line, businesses only need 1 to 2 robots to operate that whole line with a shorter time or even many lines at the same time. Finally, artificial intelligence enables robots to learn from experience, adapt to new inputs, and execute human-like activities thereby boosting the quality of life.

To conclude, albeit disadvantageous in some cases, I believe that robots will not take over the majority of employment. By using them wisely and with precaution, robots will not only support humans but also create a desirable world."
"Some people think that competitive sports have a positive effect on the education of teenagers while others argue that the effect is negative.
Discuss both these views and give your own opinion","It’s been observed that competition in sports is influencing the young of this era. Some people believe that it’s healthy and good for one’s development especially when it comes to their education while others are not true believers in this. They think that it’s leaving a poor effect on teenagers’ education. Although sports are healthy activities for the human body, its effect varies from person to person.

Because of the multiple advantages of sports, it’s considered a healthy activity. When it comes to competitions, passion to win contributes towards polishing one’s personality. A part of the population is in favor of such competitions in which teenagers can learn to progress and win. Passion to win can play a vital role in someone’s educational history. So, people believe that if someone is competitive in sports, they will have the same attitude for their education.

On the contrary, people also think that when someone fails in any sports competition, they get negative vibes, which causes too many unavoidable situations like politics, jealousy, and so on. One can do anything to win which can harm others. It’s not limited to this only but they can join any extreme which can be disastrous for anyone involving that competition.

Summarizing the idea, I would say that competitive sports are good if they are conducted with the right terms. Competitions make one more proactive and smart. Rules should be fair enough to accommodate all involved parties. Although some people are not in favor of this, we can educate them by conducting healthy sports competitions in every educational department."
"Some people think that competitive sports have a positive effect on the education of teenagers, while others argue that the effect is negative.


Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","Some would argue that the competition in sport could collaborate positively on the education of adolescents while others think it can affect negatively. There are people who believe that can have negative effects. I believe it can be beneficial for the child.

Competitive sports can cause problems for young people when they lose, they feel they fail. For this reason, they could undermine their confidence, affecting their self-confidence. The pressure of being part of competitive sports makes them less fun and means teenagers do not want to take part in it. It would be beneficial that all governments encourage young people to be part of a competitive sport, although some of them could not perform well, some professionals should support them in overcoming any bad feelings. For instance, all  professional football clubs have psychological support for their members. I don’t think that young people who play competitive sports have a negative influence on their studies.

There are many reasons youngsters benefit from competition in sports. On the one hand, the game is a great way to reduce stress and focus the mind away from lessons. A little competition can help teenagers to focus more and give them a reason to perform better. In addition, when playing in teams, these sports help youth learn team-building skills and can improve their physical well-being, which is a really important benefit. There are many studies that involve practising sports to help people to perform better in their studies. I think the benefit of being a member of competitive sports is definitely convenient for adolescents.

To conclude, while some argue that competitive sports can undermine the confidence of young people when they fail, I believe that playing sport plays a useful role in developing minors, not only athletically but helping them to understand the value of competition and even if they fail, they feel they have achieved something."
Some people believe that climate has the greatest effect on people’s way of life. Others believe that the economy of the region has the greatest effect. Discuss both views and give your opinion,"It is argued by certain people that the weather conditions impacts more on people's lives than anything else, while a few dispute that, and instead suggest that the economy of the surrounding countries in a geographical area has more bearing. In my opinion, I feel that the floods and hurricanes that results from bad weather have a greater influence on the lives of many.In this essay, I will tackle both of these views and give a conclusion.

First of all, a terrible weather can result in hurricanes, droughts or heavy downpours. These eventualities cause havoc resulting in mass destruction of both life and property. In other words, more individuals are affected greatly than can any problem in a country. Take, for example, the hurricane Ana reported in the Southern African region which damaged countless crops and lives of people. This shows just how devastating climate can be as well as the influence it has on the masses.

On the other hand, others opine that the economic status of a region delivers the greatest impact. This is so because once a region can not manage to feed and care for its own people due to limited finances in the economy, then poverty and suffering occurs. To put this in perspective, if the global trade in a region can not accord its citizens a chance to earn money and grow economically, then a lot of lives tend to get into poverty. For instance, because of its poor international market the Eastern part of Africa experiences more civil wars which has led to millions being affected. Despite this being the case, I believe climate change is the major problem for many lives.

By way of conclusion, I reaffirm my stance that the weather should be prioritised as the main problem affecting many lives severely. To this end, more resources have to be set aside to manage the prevailing conditions."
"Movies and computer games containing violence are popular. Some people say they have a negative effect on society and should be censored. Others say they are just harmless relaxation.

Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","Recently, films and computer games which use violent images and content have become utterly widespread. Few people argue that those entertainers have an adverse effect on society and should be cénored while others consider those as normal relaxation. This study agrees that sensitive images should be banned. This article discusses both views.

On the one hand, sensitive images should be banned for one main reason. Violent images can encourage detrimental behaviour. People tend to imitate the character’s actions that he or she is influenced by. That imitation leads to adverse effects on a self and their peers. The violent images are planted in their subconscious minds and continually affect their life. It is obvious that lots of accidents have been made because of people’s illusions and imitation such as they jumping out of the windows and beating each other. Hence, rough images should be forbidden.

On the other hand, many people believe that violent entertainers are normal because they revitalize their brains after a long period of hard work.They depict that people should not take those issues too serious. Despite this, major actions are encouraged by this type of movie and video game. There are more ways of relaxation, too. This essay still disagrees with the statement that violent contents of entertaining methods are just ways of amusement. For instance, extensive research has shown the negative influence of rough content on daily life.

In conclusion, while there is a benefit of the featured films, it is obvious that the detrimental effects are more serious. As mentioned before, unsuitable content should be restricted."
"Some people think the increasing business and cultural contact between countries brings many positive effects. Others say it causes the loss of national identities.
Discuss both of these views and give your own opinion.","Trade and cultural transactions have become an integral part of the nations.Some feel that such exchanges bring more benefits to the public,whereas there are few who feel that the identity of the individual nation is lost.In my opinion,there are more benefits in terms of increased employment opportunities and there is always an introduction of new art and traditions.This essay will discuss why such networks should be promoted for the betterment of the country on the whole.

To begin with,setting up a trade requires a lot of infrastructure and manpower.This creates a lot of employment opportunities locally for the citizens,who sometimes migrate to other areas for employment.Furthermore, a lot of revenue is generated for the country in the form of taxes paid by the foreign business for the infrastructure, leading to  strong  economic growth.Additionally, the exchange of cultures between the countries broadens the horizon of the local group.For example,a branch office of Google employs nearly three thousand local employees giving them a lot of benefits in addition to taxes it gives to the local authorities.People get to know the practice of  other countries including their food and fashion.BTS boy band is globally known all  by everyone due to these changes.

On the other hand,people in their gist of adopting a new culture,forget their own traditions ,which many fear may get  forgotten over a period of time.And also it has been noticed that foreign business often affect the local business.Every country has their own unique culture and sometimes the mix with other cultures may obliterate the roots of the country.For instance,Indians adopt western culture often 

forgetting their roots.Local businesses are going out of the market after Amazon started their venture in India.An important part of the country which shaped it might get lost in the future,if steps are not taken to preserve it.

To conclude,trade and culture exchanges have become a part and parcel of the modern world.This has led to a dilution of the countries culture and traditions;however,it has generated more jobs and a stronger economy."
"Many people believe that modern music can have a negative impact on the young. Others believe the effect of modern music is positive.
Discuss both these views and give your opinion","Issues related to modern music are frequently discussed these days. Some people believe that music today has a negative impact on the youngest people. Others criticize and argue that modern music can positively affect the young. Both sides of view and the explanation will be discussed in the following paragraphs.

On the one hand, there are several reasons why the effect of the digital age music shows negative ways. The principal reason is that the young lack  careful thought about good and bad things. To explain, most adolescents are usually influenced by their favourite artists in terms of following styles as well as characteristics. Hence, some impolite actions, such as smoking and shouting, can lead their younger fans to follow. For instance, in Thailand, some boys try to smoke in the classroom since they want to be like their favourite rappers in the show without thinking of the drawbacks of smoking.

On the other hand, opponents may argue that the modern style of rhythms has a greater impact on the younger generation. The main point is that most children always have a lot of energy; thus, dancing with modern rhythm can be a great solution for releasing their powers without fighting. This means that relaxing with melody is one of the suitable sports categories in the young age group. 

For example, today most children like to dance with the popular music in Tik-Tok applications.

Another point of the merits is that listen to music in younger people, such as the classical style, can have a positive result in the enhancement of their brains according to many kinds of research. To exemplify, many English teachers use  music in order to teach their pupils as these lyrics can lead pupils to concentrate on the lessons more than reading a book.

All things considered; I am of the opinion that the advantages of modern singing significantly outweigh the disadvantages in many aspects. Therefore, parents and media’s organizations should share responsibilities and have an awareness of their offspring as well as the future generation."
Many people believe that modern music can have a negative impact on the young. Others believe the effect of modern music is positive. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.,"Some people claim that contemporary music has issues on the youth generation whereas others think the opposite and defend the benefits of listen music. This essay will discuss both sides of this situation and explain the reasons why music has more pros than cons in the teenagers.

Listening music is good for all ages because it can change our mood quick and bring different emotions. The youth people have been overestimulated for many devices and they have had some issues with tasks that required concentration. Lo-fi beats, for example, can regulate the heartbeats and breathing in a way that helps to keep focus on one task for many hours. Therefore, this type of music could be very helpful nowadays with attention disorders, which becomes more and more common among teens. Another beneficial example in the kids is the lyrics because it is a kind of poem with a message behind. For many years, music teaches through its stories about culture, experiences and impressions of the world. Therefore style, lyrics and rhythm are always changing to adapt to the new generation of listeners or keeping memory alive.

On the other hand, it is not all songs that we can consider beneficial for youngs. In this phase of life, they are still figuring out their characters and personalities and some noise as referred to as music, could not be good for them. For example,  Brazilian funk is very popular among youngs and teens, however, the lyrics are always incentiviting to commit crimes, rape women and consume drugs. Therefore, if I had a teen close to me, I would never allow him to listen those kind of music.

In my opinion, music is extremely good and could help in different moments in life, especially for our kids; but requires attention of the parents to overseas what type of music their children are listening.

To conclude, music has by far and large more benefits than problems to influence young people because it can change emotions or tell experiences, even though some type of music could have a negative impact."
Some believe that people should make efforts to fight climate change while others think it is better to learn to live with it.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Some people believe that people should take steps battling against the climate change, however, others argue that it is not their matter of concern and should leave as it is. I advocate that small change in human activities can save the earth from bad energies of global warming. In this essay i will discuss both views by analyzing how collective action of humans can bring big change, even though the climate change is a natural process.

On the one hand, although the change in environmental weather making life difficult and harming in different ways; Many creatures are in endangered stage,  few think that it is out of control and can not make any change. As a result, many creatures are in endanger stage. Furthermore, It is a part of natural change  and prefereably not changeble. Such as volcano, tsunami, earthquake these are natural calamities and happens as a part of its process not because of human activities, so it should be left as it is.

 On the other hand, many argue that this an effect of luxurious living style and if the way of living is changed, it can be minimized. Peple can contribute their interest by requesting the government to make certain rules and relurate accordingly, suport scientist and encourage them to research more on how to reduce the consequences of global warming, and techonologist to invent new technology, which can stop the bad effect at the atmosphare. Thus, people should take part in saving earth from climate change. The Tesla car can be taken as illustration, which is run by battery that do not  emit carbon gas .

In conclusion, although action of people discharge little or no carbon gas as comparision to what amount natural disasters emit, it can be managed by human power since they are able to think innovatively and invent new technology."
"Many people believe that modern music can have a negative impact on the young. Others believe the effect of modern music is positive.
Discuss both these views and give your opinion.","Most individuals think that modern music can have negative impact on youngsters, while others think it provides positive impact to them. To my opinion, Modern music only brings negative impact to todays youngsters, because, most music has no social values and causes ill-effects to them and their community.

People who believe that modern music provides them positive impact doesn't realize that, music is rhythm, which should provide good message and peace of mind. Comparing to older songs modern songs have too much instrument noises, which is also in high pitch. Recent songs has less words, most of the words are not clear in pronunciation, therefore it doesn't provide any value to the listeners. People argue that the tunes present in the music gives then peace of mind while listening, which is a valid point, but, there are only few songs has been released like such in recent times. Considering these modern music can't provide any positive impact to todays youngsters.

When it comes to an negative impact, modern music causes more bad effects to the young generations and to their community. Recent generation people prefer to hear songs using headphone, this instrument makes noises closer to the ears. When music has high pitch noise heard in such manner causes ear failure, due to this people will become deaf sooner. Todays music is causing more anger and rage in youngsters, because, the high instrument noises causes them to do more aggressive things. This kind of behavior causes unnecessary problems to their surroundings and their community, therefore modern music only provide negative impact to this society.

In conclusion, Modern music isn't like old music which provide social message and pleasant to hear. It only causes ill-effects on youngsters and make them to act aggressively while hearing them, this eventually cause bad situations to them and make a bad impression over them in this community."
"The number of TV programs is growing day by day. Some people say it is good as it gives people more choices, while others say it affects the quality of TV programs. 
Discuss both the views and give your opinion.","Television shows assist  people to relax and enjoy. But, nowadays, the number of Television plays are rapidly increasing.Because of this, humans are in real confusion to choose the one to watch. Along with this, the quality of these broadcast is still debatable. In my view, it is good to have more choices but, all the shows should promise about the quality of telecast also. This essay will examine the topic in detail in the following paragraphs.

   To begin with, because of the arrival of dish antenna now persons are more accessible to opt the channel according to their wish. Moreover, plenty of programs satisfy their selection. Besides this, youngsters are getting a plethora of chances to express their talents through competitive shows. For example, a study conducted by Banaras Hindu University, India proved that the present generation is getting more options to share their ideas than in the past one. To summarize, more programs bring more opportunities to children as well as lots of choices to adults.

On the contrary, there are unnecessary competitions going on between the telecast. However, unique kind of play telecast by two different channels will affect the quality of the program. Apart from this, people may get bored easily by watching the same kind of repeated broadcast. To exemplify, if one starts with a musical show means the opposite channel also will start the same kind of play by adding little changes. But the viewers can easily catch that. 

Finally, although lots of channels offer many choices also, the broadcast standard

 is still questionable. In my personal opinion, it is nice to have many choices but all shows should maintain good quality also."
Some people believe that climate has the greatest effect on people’s way of life. Others believe that the economy of the region has the greatest effect. Discuss both views and give your opinion,"It is believed by some that climate has the most significant impact on people’s lives, while others argue that the economy is the most significant factor. I believe that a good economy enables people to disregard the effects of climate and thus the economy is the overriding factor.

On the one hand, the main reason given by those who believe that climate has the greatest impact is that climate determines the variability and availability of natural resources people depend on like food, water, and energy. For example, deserts are scarcely populated because of the hot climate which leads to water scarcity. Climate influences how people live and what jobs they do. People’s lifestyle including what they eat, what clothes they wear, the type of houses they live in, all in some way or another depending upon the climate the region experiences. Similarly, ice fishing is the most common profession in cold frozen countries, while agriculture is the most common profession in warm and humid climates.

On the other hand, those who believe that economy is the principal factor say that because the economy frames the choices and decisions people make regarding work, leisure, consumption, and how much to save. For example, in rich and developed countries, people tend to spend more as the governments can provide social security in the form of pensions and free health care, while in poor countries people are more likely to save. Similarly, developed countries with good economies have a more educated workforce and thus their citizens secure better jobs, while people from poor developing countries are seen employed as labour.

In the past, I believe climate had a major impact on life, but today the impact of climate can be limited by a good economy. The biggest evidence for this can be seen in the oil-rich middle eastern countries, which have established modern cities in the middle of deserts with the help of their rich economies. Their people today have the same facilities and luxuries as available in other developed countries, despite the region’s harsh climate.

In conclusion, I would like to reiterate that although both climate and economy impact people’s way of life, the impact of the economy is certainly more."
Some people think that the range of technology currently available is increasing the gap between rich people and poor people. Others think that it is causing the opposite effect. Discuss both the views and give your opinion.,"It is irrefutable that in past few years, development in technology has been touched the sky significantly. With the help of technology, the option for making money is also increased. However, a particular group of people opines that recent technology is increasing the gap between wealthy and poor people. While another group of people thinks in the reverse method. Before commenting on my own opinion both the views should be discussed further.

On the one hand, some people think that technology is the reason for increasing space between the upper class and lower-class persons. One of the main reasons behind this is that Morden technology is very costly and people with less money cannot buy them. Also, this machinery for easing life is very essential for day-to-day life. For example, poor people with no technological facility have to work hard to earn money and wealthy people can easily excess this facility and due to this their productivity is increasing at some point and this leads to an increase in their money flow. This would create a huge impact on money circulation in rich and poor people.

On the other hand, some people believe that increase in tech equipment the risk level is decreasing and the earning of all kind of people has increased in past few years. Technology is providing an equal chance to all people to earn the money and money is flowing unidirectionally. Because of this, the living standard of humankind is also rising and due to this, the gap between the rich and poor is filling so fast.

To encapsulate, I would say that, although the range of technology helps rich people to double their income to a certain level and improve their lifestyle. But it also helps poor people to create the same chance to earn the money for improving their lifestyle by reducing the money gap between rich people and poor people."
"Some believe that people should make efforts to fight climate change while others think it is better to learn to live with it.


Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Some people have substantially paid attention to climate change by reducing plastic, CFC and a lot, whereas others think that we should learn to adapt to it. This essay will discuss both views and put my opinion.

Nowadays, there is a great amount of pollution in the air, which has produced using cars, plastic, CFC and others. However, some people want to have a better globe, so they have made efforts to change our Earth, that they have generally kept many tasks on a road or elsewhere including reducing plastic caps and other ways. In addition,  climate change has affected  everything in the world, for example, increasing temperatures over years have melted icebergs, which are located in the North pole and South pole, including if someone unable to adapt to this problem, he will die from many reporting. Therefore, these are reasons why they decide to protect our Earth.

On the other hand, others think that is unnecessary to prevent it, and they should learn how they will stay in this climate change. Moreover, they do not care about this problem, 

as well as have increased more pollution, that plastic and CFC should use to be enough to cover their money. Additionally, they might be convinced that, in the future, there are many projects to observe a new planet that resembles our Earth. To illustrate, Elon mark has a schema for observing  Mars, that will habitat for humanity in the future.

To conclude, in my opinion, I personally think that we should protect or treat it by reducing things which worsen the world, and the government is supposed to persuade its population to be more careful."
Some people think that robot technology is very important for our future. Others believe that robots are a dangerous invention and have negative effects on society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Robots technology plays a vital role in almost every domain of business and personal work. Some individual thinks that robotics is very beneficial for human growth. While others believe that it is having detrimental effects on society. Here in the essay, both views will be discussed along with my personal opinion.

Robots made people life very easy as it saves person time to perform the difficult task very easily along with that work performed by robots are more efficient with zero bugs. Moreover, robots are helpful to perform dodgy jobs which is very dangerous for human life. For instance, machines can be used to remove radioactive waste from nuclear power plants. other dangerous jobs like electric lineman , stuntmen , firefighters can be performed with help of robots. However, robots do efficient work it is also more productive as human become bored and lazy while doing repetitive work but Otherside robots can do it without any hesitation as the same command needs to put and they can do same work as long as you want. 

On the flip side, with the widespread use of machines there are many consequences that arise. As there are massive levels of involuntary unemployment. Along with that, the use of machines in place of humans cause a lot of accidents in the workplace. For instance, tesla accident by autonomous driving . 

In my opinion, robots offer more positive effect than the dangerous and negative effect and detrimental effects caused by robots can be solved by the government by imposing some laws. So , all the problems brought by robots can be solved."
Some people think that climate change could have a negative effect on business. Other people think that climate change could create more business opportunities. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Many people reveal their opinions about the negative effect of climate change that causes bad time in business. Meanwhile, others think this environment issues could lead to more creative opportunities in the business. According to this statement, I believe that climate change is the importance issues induced by human especially in the industrials which involving in business. Climate change can make the business need to restrict their rules in their industrial factors to adapt to globalize environmental issues. However, it the sign of an improvement through the business models to live as a sustainable business and harmless to the resources of the planet as much as they can.

It is a tendency to believe that climate issues are the big factors that cause a negative effect on business. For example, many industrial factories such as water drinking companies are now facing the problem of massive draughts and rare of freshwater to manufactured. This reason is from the climate issues which including greenhouses effect and the increasing of ocean levels and destroyed balance of freshwater in many locations around the world. The water company has less production than the consumption requires. This is why climate change issues affect the business.

From another point of view, There are the greatest opportunities for business to create their ways of a sustainable company. For instance, the big department stores such as Pink N Pay or Wall Marts are now reducing the plastic bag and encourage the customers to concerns more about environmental issues. These company will change the money for whom that need the plastic bag when they come to the shopping center."
"The number of TV programs is growing day by day. Some people say it is good as it gives people more choices, while others say it affects the quality of TV programs. 
Discuss both the views and give your opinion.","Technology is regarded as cradle of various entertainment means. A rapid rise in TV channels has been observed in contempoThe number of TV programs is growing day by day. Some people say it is good as it gives people more choices, while others say it affects the quality of TV programs. 

Discuss both the views and give your opinion.rary times. A section of society argues that it is beneficial as there will be more alternatives, whereas a certain class thinks it hampers the worth of shows. In this essay, I will discuss both the sides of the given argument and will reach to an appropriate conclusion.

A group favours multiple programs primarily because of the range it offers. With increased number, the variety of genre is available which interest individuals. Often, the liking for anything differs from person to person, so everyone can benefit with type of shows they like. To illustrate, Zee TV, a famous Indian entertainment channel, maintained highest TRP for consecutive 5 years as the shows involved categories like crime, food, movies and songs.

On the contrary, there are people who think the value of programs decline if they are in bulk. Foremost, in order to provide multiple shows, there is a compulsion on TV producers. Consequently they come up with any type of show which might not be appealing but just for the sake. For example, currently, people prefer to watch TV only on specific time for a particular show which they like as they do not find every program interesting.

To conclude, although both the sides have their own intrinsic worth, I think having limited but meaningful programs are more appropriate than just having them for the sake of having them. Such programs are meant for the entertainment of individuals, if they do not fulfil that objective then it is of no use."
Some people believe that robots are very important for human future development. Others argue that the invention of robots has negative effects on society. Discuss both views and give your opinion (approximately 250 words),"People have different viewpoints on whether the creation of automatons supports the advancement of human life in tomorrow or it merely brings problems for humanity. While the entrance of androids to daily life can cause some inconveniences, I would argue that they are useful to accompany human growth.

On the one hand, there are many reasons against the use of robots. Firstly, one of the biggest concerns surrounding the introduction of robotic automation is potential job losses. If a robot can run at a faster and more constant pace, even in dangerous tasks, thus it could lead to unemployment. Secondly, robots can do all repetitive movements or tasks from what they are programmed to do. With the intensive application of robots, humans can become overly dependent on machines, losing their mental and physical abilities. Also, if the control of robots is not working properly, they can cause destruction.

On the other hand, I believe that there are several benefits of using cyborgs in service to improve human life quality. The first could be that robots can work in harsh environments such as areas that require extremely high or low temperatures, and those that present a high level of chemicals. In such cases, automated robots offer the ideal solution, as they will continue to operate without damage, thereby minimizing material waste and eliminating unnecessary risks to human safety. The second is the constant productivity of automatons. By differentiating from humans whose breaks are required in the working time and sometimes their attention span slows down, robots can work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and keep working at 100% efficiency to serve non-stop to humanity. Besides, robots do not take vacations or have unexpected absences.

In conclusion, although the usage of robots can implant some negative impacts on human life, it seems to me that all the innovations of technology have the same purpose of making a better quality of mankind life and the point is that we should find a mechanism to take maximum advantages and limit drawbacks of them to enjoy technology era."
Some people think that the range of technology currently available is increasing the gap between rich people and poor people. Others think that it is causing the opposite effect. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"The 21st century ushered in various forms of technological innovation, which has made life easier for people. Some persons believe this advanced gadgets contribute to the widening gap between the rich and the poor while others opined that the reverse is the case. this essay will look at both sides of the argument.

Advent of different types of technologies in various spheres of human lives has gone a long way in the betterment of living conditions for both the affluent and the less privileged. For instance, Computers do not discriminate between its users and does not classify individuals into social strata. It receives commands from both the wealthy and the poverty stricken as long as you know the right command to key in thus showing that the benefits of scientific innovations are available for use by both the rich and the poor.

Although advanced equipment abound for utilization by the residents of every society, these technological inventions might not be readily accessible to certain members of the populace due to the expenses needed to procure them. For example, a man from the lower social class who cannot feed himself three times daily will not invest in a computerized wristwatch even when the advantages of the latter are numerous while a person at the top of the ladder of economic success can afford to have a garage full of sophisticated cars and motorcycles not minding the cost of buying them. A man walking down the street without a means of transportation and another who drove past in a Ferrari are definitely not on the same rung of the economic ladder. this is an aspect in which it can be noted that technology further widens the gap between the poor and the rich.

In conclusion, I believe the pros of technological advancement far outweighs the problems of widened space between the people of lesser and higher means. thus, I think its sustenance should be encouraged and the government can provide subsidies on the price of these advanced equipments making it easily accessible for the poor and this can help to close up this invisible gap between different social strata."
some people think that robots are very important to human future development. others think that they are dangerous and have negative effects on society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Technology has become an integral part of human's life due to its advancement and smartness. Therefore, plenty of people reckon that artificial intelligence like robots are highly lucrative for future enhancement of this modern world. However, others think the contrary and say that although robots are beneficial yet it can affect badly to the society. Having discussed both views I will discuss my opinion reasonably deeply.


Proponents of robots suggest some advantageous points such as it can work 24/7 hours without any break and more fast comparatively and robots can be sent into dangerous places. Initially, not only will robots enhance the productivity of the company, but also it cannot strain the budget of any farm because robots do not take rest and paid leave. Therefore, robots are a one time investment, it just take repair occasionally. Thus, it has become first priority of every company ranging from small to medium to big. Besides this, robots can also quite lucrative for hazardous work such as mining and underwater research which can jeopardise the lives of humans. For example, a survey conducted by Oxford University showed that the ratio of deaths has decreased in dangerous places since the robots are launched.


Every coin has two sides, where the robot has merits there some demerits can also been seen such as eradicates labour jobs. First of all, although artificial intelligence will benefit to farms, yet it can lead to unemployment because robots do not need to rest but humans have to. And robots work quickly relatively. Therefore, labour work can be demolished by artificial intelligence. For an illustration, the Indian newspaper published an article showing that since the Apple company has installed robots instead of humans, 20% employees of Apple have kicked out of jobs. Self-evidently, these are the points which prove the disadvantages of robots.


To conclude, having discussed both views, I convinced to say that although companies will earn high profits, but this technology can eradicate the jobs and lead to unemployment and poverty."
"Some people think that children should not watch television because it has negative effects, while others believe that television helps children. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","It is argued that television must not be watched by children. While some individuals say that it has an opposing impact on children, I would argue that it brings various benefits to them. 
On the one hand, there are a number of reasons why some people think that the children’s development can be affected by watching TV. The first reason is that sitting in front of the screen for too long is harmful to children’s health. Many kids these days suffer from health problems such as obesity, short-sighted as prolong watching TV. Another reason is that many TV programs and movies have violent contents and sexual images that are inappropriate for children to watch. These violent movies accidentally put the children into violent behaviours, which ruin their future. 
On the other hand, I believe that television plays an important role in children’s development. Watching educational TV programs gives children an opportunity to broaden their minds and enrich their knowledge about the world they live in. Discovery Channels or Documentary is the typical examples. These channels not only help children to understand the natural habitat, but also educate them about the importance of protecting our environment. Moreover, watching television helps children whose native languages are not English exposure to the conversational of spoken English. This is a natural learning language method that makes children, enhancing their listening and speaking skills. Kids who absorb English TV programs tend to study English faster and mimic the accent better than kids watching foreign TV channels. 
In conclusion, although some people say that watching TV damage to children, I would argue that it is beneficial for them."
Some people think advertisements may have positive economic effects whereas others think there are negative social effects because individuals are not satisfied with who they are and what they have. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"For the time being, a commercial has been growing and broadening influence, due to have been changing technologies and increasing sell which have a positive impact on the income of companies. However, society throughout years has been noticing degradation among consumers, because they more time have been choosing things imposed by advertising and almost lost their own opinion. Overall, I think we could avoid negative effects and get more positive for everybody if use advertisement carefully.
Thus, in the beginning the advertisement was developed with the good aims inasmuch as advertising clip should give consumers wide options to choice. Besides, via such video companies could make highly competitive conditions among one-type products. Now an advertisement around us permanently because gets access to more gadgets such as the internet, a billboard, the TV and so on. Therefore, new products and companies get more chances to represent them for better selling. 
However, throughout years clip makers have been finding out methods manipulate of an audience by repeatedly represents, repeat words, or, even, implement some technology that impairs on psychology of consumers. For example, early in the century had shown much news about a twenty-fifth of frame that imposed people to buy this product then throughout plenty of years different source to try denied this information. Moreover, many advertisements show standards of beauty via new creams or other products that make women more beautiful or help lose weight that leads to doubt about their appearance. Besides, many companies via advertising have been selling not quality products because of a good clip outweigh high quality in our time. Thus, a good start turns to something ambiguous.
To sum up, I believe advertising as good as other methods of product promotions. However, necessary to restrict using such videos and turn them to a style that is more comparative than attractive and intrusive."
"Some people think that families have the most powerful influence on a child’s development, while others think other factors such as television, friend, music. etc. gave biggest effects. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","About child development, two opposing views have been discussed, one of which is related to parenting effects on personal evolution, while the other is about environmental factors such as television, friends. From my perspective, families are the first and most important factors of early age development.

According to the perspective of some, children can receive/get more influence from their families, since they might believe that social, educational and emotional needs first meet with the family. The rationale behind their thought might be the period that passes from birth to kindergarten, which is under the influence of the parents only; since this period of time has significant value in a child’s progress. I also support this point of view and believe that the backbone of a nature is created at that time.

For some other people, however, the effect of televisions or friends might be more than family factor in a child’s improvement, since they might believe that specifically, human nature will be able to change in future. Yet, I am not on the same page as these people. For instance, to my way of thinking gained nature cannot be changed, but possibly manipulated for temporarily. Therefore, personal improvement is a permanent fact, so that the influence of the environment cannot be as powerful as parent’s one.

In conclusion, what can be concluded from the aforementioned remarks is that although some individuals such as advocate families are the main factors of an individual's personality. I firmly believe that despite the effects of friends and television, parents are the key that shapes a child's personality."
Some people think that climate change could have a negative effect on business. Other people think that climate change could create more business opportunities. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"The proponents of the view that climate change could be harmful to business may believe that the increasing frequency of extreme weather events occurring as a result of climate change, such as drought, flood, earthquake, and typhoon, would disturb regular production and consumption in the market, thus destabilizing the economy. When disasters occur recurrently, people could hardly engage in commercial activities, but to struggle for survival. Besides, the financial loss caused by these disasters, usually on a large scale, would reduce business viability. For example, expensive facilities and equipment in companies and factories would be destroyed by flood or earthquake, and thus more money has to be spent on repair or purchase of new replacements. 

On the contrary, other people believe climate change would bring more opportunities to business. This is so probably because governments always seek partnership with the private sector to develop novel technology and new means to combat challenges like climate change, and this will grant companies sharing the same goal more resources and support. For example, governments may make substantial investments in the green industry and thus sponsor firms aiming to research and produce eco-friendly products. In addition, as people have to change their lifestyles either to adapt to the new weather or to attempt to mitigate climate change, new demands will be created, which could be opportunities for business to develop new products and services accordingly.

In my opinion, disasters brought about by climate change would not be a big deal in the future, because human beings are smart and hardworking enough to cope with all sorts of challenges brought about by climate change. And this has been sufficiently proved by the human history during which people were recurrently confronted with challenges and continuously overcome them. The commercial sector could contribute to the discovery of innovative solutions to problems facing human beings, and, in return, gain more chance to make profits. Therefore, I tend to believe that business would obtain more opportunities created by climate change."
Some people think competitive sport is important for a child's education. Others think it has negative effects on children. Discuss both views and give your opiniion,"It is often believed by certain individuals that competitive sports aids in children's education, while others opine that these have detrimental effects. This essay will discuss both views and agrees that children should be motivated to participate in competitive sports as this has a positive impact on children overall development
It is undoubtedly true that sports competitions help children learn social skills as well as gain confidence. This is to say, when younger generations participate in various sporting contests, they not only make new friends, but also acquire societal skills such as listening and speaking ability, working in a team, being a kid and looking after their friends. Furthermore, sports build their self-confidence which helps them to grab opportunities and challenges along with working hard to achieve all the goals. To elucidate, a recent study by The Times on March 2017 showed that more than 80 percent of young children who engage in competitive sports are more successful in achieving all the objective of their life
However, others disagree and feel that competitive events have an overall negative impact on children. Youngsters develop an attitude of win-at-all-cost mentality that can lead to attitude problem. This to say, the and this causes mental stress. This is to say, when children participate in competitive events they practice immensely hard day and night to succeed and get the first position. This leads to mental and emotional breakdown. As a consequence, kids are not able to concentrate on their studies, which eventually affects their overall development as well as their future. To exemplify, a recent survey conducted by the National Science of Neurology found that more than 70 percent of children when participate in competitive events suffer from anxiety and some form of depression.
To conclude, while the benefits of participating in competitive events help children to enhance their skill sets and to become more proficient in their studies, while some believe that this leads to increase in their stress level which hamper their education. However, i vehemently agree, that despite of few disadvantages, children should be encouraged and motivated by their parents to participate in competitive sports as this will help to develop their overall character and school performance, which will be beneficial for their future."
"Nowadays families move to different countries for work. Some people think it has a negative effect on children, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Advances in technology and transportation have made globalization much easier, accordingly multinational corporations have become considerably more widespread all over the word and as a result, it is more common to be an expect than it was in the past, some people believe that the children of those families could benefit from the experience of living in foreign countries, while others oppose this idea. I, for one, consider myself to be one of the advocates of the second opinion. In the hereunder paragraph more details, with more insight of both opinions, shall be indicated.

Living in a foreign country would be a great opportunity to learn about a new language, as well as being exposed to a different culture, such experience would help in widening the spectrum of any individual, regardless of age, thus children will be enriched by being those different experiences, becoming more open minded, making it easier to accept people from different backgrounds with different habits and customs, moreover learning a new language should enable youngsters to be more quick learners, studies show that learning more than one language at a young age could aid them in acquiring other subjects that are not related to their linguistic abilities, such as mathematics and science.

On the other hand some other opnions, such as mine, are disagreeing with this idea, since raising younger generations in foreign country could adhere them from learning their native language, because most countries only teach their local language at school, especially in elementary levels, unless one of their parents is able to dedicate part of his or hers time to teach the child the language of his parents country, but this is not always achievable, because usually parents who live outside their homeland are less likely to have enough time for this responsibility or they might not be even have enough knowledge to teach their mother tongue efficiently, in addition the child would unfortunately would have less opportunities to practice his native language, as a cause for living in a community that do not use this language. Also the youngsters might be detached from their local culture, as a result of not having any hands on experience with it.

To conclude, I restate my opinion that children raised in foreign countries might suffer greatly from living abroad, to mitigate those negative effect their parents should encourage them to learn their native language, whether by themselves or by the aid of centres that could help them in learn their homeland language and they could minimize the cultural gap by strengthening their ties with other citizens of the same nationality that share similar background, in order to be accustomed to their native roots."
Some people think that climate change could have a negative effect on business. Other people think that climate change could create more business opportunities. Discuss both views give your own opinion.,"It is thought by some people, that climate change will decrease the business process all around the world, other think about advantages it will bring to the entrepreneurs. This essay will first discuss the negative effect on the economy of the planet and then it will suggest some possibilities of this transformations.

On the one hand, the issue of the ecology has significantly grown in importance over the last 20 years. Whether pollution is a price to pay for prosperity or a dangerous by-product of senseless capitalistic system is a debatable topic especially in the West. Humanity in 21 century are the society of consuming, not only the government have to fight with overproduction goods, but also particular individual has to reform the style of his life. According to the latest research carried out at the Oxford University 5% products, that costumers buy they do not even use or use 1 or 2 times.

On the other hand, eco friendly production is a great opportunity to reorganize our lives. The first measure to be introduced is to stop producing plastic pockets and disposable plastic goods, the second measure is to reduce the taxes on green projects and to help with researching in eco industry. For example, the New York Times recently reported that country would allocate 10 millions dollars for young green scientists.

In conclusion, I believe that the benefits of green life are more weighty than minuses, also taking care about our planet is a challenge for everyone in other words, it is our mission in the future."
"Some people believe that competitive sports have a positive effect on children’s education, while others believe there is no place for such sports in schools. Discuss both points of view and give your own opinion.","Having intention for the sport games sould take a indispensable part in pupil’s life beacuse it has more effect than we thought. Even though according to the some lazy and sluggish parents think sport is just a time sucker, experts have the opposite idea for this matter.
    Current social experiments performed that competitive sports hold the super affirmative effect on the children’s self-confidences together with the proffesors who led the research, say it is also very useful to learn how to behave if you are on the losing side. Moreover, it can improve your group action skills and you might learn how to be unit for beat the rival. I would like to give an instance fort his conflict. I was at the primary school when ı started attending chess competition and official basketball games. İndisputably I learned there how to cope with compulsories and if you want the achievement you need to endeavour for acquiring what you wish. Afterwards my examination results started increasing instantly. Then i perceived that it had contributed me a plethora of caractheristic qualifications in a long time. Last but not the least it gives you a power to tackle with your examinations and homeworks. Moreover if you are interested in competition games such as basketball, football, curling then you will be learned how to behave your opponent in this sitiuation your opponent would be your friends.
  
   Briefly, I would like to call out to the parents whose children is keen on competitive sport, to set them free, and it will affect their education life in the way it affected mine."
Some people think that the range of technology currently available is increasing the gap between rich people and poor people. Others think that it is causing the opposite effect. Discuss both the views and give your opinion.,"Cutting-edge technology has been upgrading the modern lifestyle with its widespread availability. Some analysts claim that it is the cause of widening the gap between the affluent and the indigent, while others opine the opposite view. However, In my opinion, I would consent to the former notion that the more earning people attain more amenities of the advanced technology, eventually, rich people become richer while the poor become poorer. 
On one side of the argument, some people believe that the distance between the wealthy people and the impoverished has been enhancing gradually because of having less trouble to access sophisticated technology. This is because modern facilities are significantly expensive, and sometimes only affordable for rich people. To exemplify, modern appliances such as washing machine, vacuum cleaner, air conditioner, etc. have brought more convenience in the regular life. Thus, only the wealthy person can make it possible to lead a better life with the aid of up-to-date technology. 
One the other hand, others provide the opposing case that the diverse range of modern avails can generate a balanced society. The reason for their belief is that the leading-edge technology creates numerous online job opportunities such as online food delivery service, online riding service and so on. Consequently, this advancement makes a great contribution to the poor people's livings through earning extra money.
However, In my opinion, though advanced technology emanates the source of income for the poor, ultimately, the affluent acquire the amenities of this tremendously than the impoverished. For instance, all the high profile businesses can potentially afford the highly expensive necessaries to accelerate their productivity whereas the poor countries hardly manage. Therefore, the imbalance nation has been increasing because of widespread technology.
In conclusion, while people may vary in their opinions, I firmly believe that the extreme availability of hi-tech divides the civilization into two parts, richer and poorer."
"Some people think that students benefit from going to private secondary schools. Others, however, feel that private secondary schools can have a negative effect on society as a whole. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","World population is increasing in such a way that every person in the country can not enjoy the facilities provided by its Government. One among such debatable subject is secondary in every locality. This discussion is my opinion that proves a private institution has not had any negative side as many of the people considering. 

Indeed, public secondary schools are very limited in every country. The Government can not establish a public school in  all villages or localities. This can be because of its economic liability or may be due to some other reasons. For example, a poor economy with below average income cannot invest to operate a public institution in each village. Hence every pupil will not get benefited. 

However, a private party who has the capability to establish and operate an educational institution are always helpful. They could successfully run an educational institution with necessary permissions from the ruling Government, in order to maintain the quality as per the requirements of the country's educational system. For example, obviously a private school can provide with more facilities, according to the need of every student. This way a private school cannot have a negative effect. In addition, this gives a small income to the Government.

In conclusion, public secondary schools are limited to provide educational facilities to every aspirant in a country. On the other hand, a privately funded school would be much beneficial to the crowd. Also, the Government should encourage such initiatives from the people so that they would feel benefited and no negative effects on society as general."
Some people think that the range of technology available to people is increasing the gap between the rich and the poor. Others think it has an opposite effect. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Some people often think that the availability of the technological advancements nowadays are raising the distance between the wealthy and the poor, while others believe it has an opposing effect. In the following essay, I will discuss about both views.

On the one hand, with the introduction of newer and better versions of current technologies, the older models would become cheaper. For example, almost everyone owns an iron, washing machine or a mobile phone even if they are not the latest models with the best options. Also, due to the internet being accessible everywhere, online shopping facilities, e-learning opportunities and social networking sites have no discrimination and are accessible by both the affluent and the poor and therefore decreases the gap between the wealthy and the poor.

However, On the other hand, certain cutting edge innovations may not be available to everyone due to their costs.  For instance, certain medical diagnostic scans like MRI and certain anticancer drugs, as well as organ transplants are very costly and inaccessible to the poor, whereas the wealthy people just have to spend a portion of their income to access these treatments and become healthy. Poor people, nevertheless, have to spend all of their expenses on conventional treatments and yet there is no guarantee that their condition will improve.

To conclude, most of the current innovations decrease the gap between the affluent and the poor, while certain developments make society more polarized. In my opinion, in the near future, most of the technologies would continue to be affordable by everyone regardless of their economic status."
"The increase in the production of consumer goods (food, clothing) results in damage to the natural environment. What is the cause of this? What can be done to solve this problem?","Nowadays, the production number of customer goods has exceeded the total amount of permittable goods distributed throughout the demographics of society which might instigate detrimental side effects on the environment. The plausible causes of this phenomenon are nature exploitation and unfiltered toxic waste disposal as a result of the large production of manufactured goods and the cultivating solutions would be to conduct environmental restoration, minimize the use of goods, and execute toxic waste detoxification.

In the following decades, as the need for goods has been increasing and expanding, more and more natural resources are being exploited. For instance, the massive use of palm oil, the raw material to produce chocolate and the main ingredient for frying which originated mainly in developing countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand often took over a large number of palm tree forests in these regions. This, if not being controlled in a sufficient way, would result in deforestation, a purposeful act to clear out large areas of forest lands. Deforestation in many ways threatens the livelihood of wild animals and disrupts the animal ecosystem. As the ecosystem dies, the animals that live in the ecosystem would eventually be eradicated and thus, diminishing biodiversity. In addition, hazardous waste attained from the post-manufacture of household commodities such as spa bath, detergent, and soap that is thrown in the ocean would defile the water and as a result, fish dies, and oceans are polluted. For that reason, the natural environment is damaged. 

The cogent solutions to these problems are to reinstate the environment through reforestation. For every ten palm trees being taken for producing cooking oil, ten more trees could be replanted. Furthermore, eliminating its use whilst implementing a green lifestyle and utilizing eco-friendly goods would prevent massive exploitation. For instance, replacing palm oil with fish oil would lessen the number of palm trees being cut. Last but not least, detoxification is one way to purify the waste that is produced from manufactured goods. A range of equipment and machines with advanced technology that could filtrate dangerous substances in water waste would eliminate the number of oceans being contaminated. 

In conclusion, the high number of consumer goods production might lead to several environmental destructions including deforestation and water pollution and the sufficient solutions to these issues are reforestation, eco-friendly product consumption, and waste purification through technology."
"Many people argue that in order to improve educational quality, high school students are encouraged to make comments or even criticism on their teachers. Other think it will lead to loss of respect and discipline in the classroom.

Discuss both views and give your Opinion.","While some folks argue that children are inspired to give comments and criticism on teachers to increase quality towards education, other believe that it decrease their respect and discipline in the class. In my opinion, I consider that students can loss their respect and discipline towards teacher, if they are commenting and criticizing to their teachers. 

On the one hand, some people think that to increase educational performance students are uplifted to make comments and criticism on their students. To commence with, students who are new in the school and want to learn something new then they are started to comment and to criticise the teacher. For example, in computer programming class students make comments to their teacher about learning new ideas after the class. Another reason is that teacher can not correct the students what they do wrong. As a result, children are starting criticising to their teacher to learn their mistakes.

On the other hand, it is often believed that making comments and criticism can lead to lose their esteem and discipline and I agree. First reason is that children, who are behaving badly towards teachers, are hated by everyone from the school. Therefore, those children stay alone in classroom and this lead to them to think bad things. For instance, children who are staying alone in the class always commenting on other students ,especially girls and teachers. Furthermore, those students are making a lots of mistakes in their assignments and exams. Due to this, students are irritated by teacher's words and say some bad comments to them. As a result, they lose their respect.

In conclusion, while people may vary in their opinion between making comments and losing respect , I think that children do not commenting and criticizing to their teachers because these behaviours lead to them in wrong path in the future."
"Many people argue that in order to improve educational quality, high school students are encouraged to make comments or even criticism on their teachers. Others think it will lead to loss of respect and discipline in the classroom. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","There is a heated argument amongst people regarding increasing the quality of education and one section of society argues that students should get support to ask queries from personnel and share disagreements on any topic whereas others oppose this and believe that it will result in disruption of the classroom’s environment. I support the former statement and this essay will put forward both  views, following with a logical conclusion. 

To commence with, there is a myriad of reasons why few individuals believe that children should enquire questions in the classroom rather than agreeing with faculty on everything  ,,however the predominant one is that  asking or disagreeing on valid things, will help kids to get a better understanding of various topics. Moreover, there should not be any harm in enquiring logical questions in a respectful manner because it will only enhance students’ knowledge and will help them to become proficient in a particular subject. For instance, in recent surveys it has been seen that many schools have initiated one–on–one discussion between children and teachers to foster their relationship, and also to provide better clarity to students on every subject. 

On the other side, few citizens argue that this practice should not be followed as it leads to disrespect of teachers, and also ruins the classroom’s environment. To support this view, the pivotal reason could be as sometimes there are few pupils who tend to ask irrelevant questions, just to disturb the flow of teaching of instructors, which creates disturbances in the room. Moreover, sometimes by correcting the teacher’s ,mistake they start thinking that the tutor  has a lack of knowledge and experience. For instance, recently in one of the schools in Gurgaon, the same incident happened, and kids went on strike to replace the teacher, who has not able to answer the queries asked  them. 

To conclude, few citizens are in the favour of supporting students to ask questions and encounter the teachers whenever needed while others oppose this attitude because sometimes kids tend to create negative notions about the tutors, which leads to  wrongful situations. However, I believe that children should inquire about their doubts without any hesitation as it enhances their knowledge, and grip on a particular subject."
"Many people argue that in order to improve educational quality, high school students are encouraged to make comments or even criticism on their teachers. Others think it will lead to loss of respect and discipline in the classroom. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","To improve the quality of education many people have the opinion that, students should be allowed to evaluate teachers to improve the quality of education. in contrast, others say that it will lead to a loss of respect for teachers and will lack discipline. This essay will discuss how teachers should be allowed to carry out their work.

First of all, granting students to make comments or evaluate teachers will lower their respect towards them. In other words, when students try to correct teachers they will have the feeling that they have more knowledge than the teacher which results in a lack of discipline. Furthermore, Teachers will not be able to teach students properly, which ultimately affects the student's academic performance. For ,instance in China, a recent survey revealed that institutions, where students  are allowed to evaluate teachers, have poor academic records and lack moral value.

On the other hand, granting students such freedom would mean giving them access to a lack of respect and order in a classroom. To put this in perspective, upon correcting a mistake by their teachers, a pupil might  begin to assume that he knows better than them. The resulting impact of this route is an indisciplined student who lacks respect for his tutors. Take ,for instance,  a survey conducted by the ministry of education in Malawi on the impact of student comments on the classroom environment, it was determined that many pupils lost respect from their teachers. No wonder the present education system deters any student from making comments or criticizing during lectures.

By way of conclusion, I reaffirm my position that not giving chance to learners in high school to comment is key in maintaining law and order at the classroom level."
"Many people argue that in order to improve educational quality, high school students are encouraged to make comments or even criticism on their teachers. Other thinks it will lead to loss of respect and discipline in the classroom. Discuss both views","Education is crucial in our present society,there is a wide range of debate  going on regarding the opinion should be taken from the learners and the other group of people opposing this idea.This essay will discuss the advantage and disadvantage of this topic.

On the one hand,commenting regarding the teaching session will be helpful for teachers to understand the ability of the child.Because every child is not capable to catch what the teacher is being taught them.Some kids are just listening only at the end they would not able to attain the score in the exams.For instance,there was a group of students were attended the classes,when they did not clear about the topic right after they clarified about the content with their teacher and she explained it in an anohter way eventually all the students through about the classes,later they got the best score in their examinations.This will help to build an intelligent and productive future generation in the community.

On the other hand,there are numerous kids who are there taking this as an advantage over the teacher.Some students do harassment of asking the unnecessary question,even some students try to invade the personal lives of teachers.,moreover,irrespective way of talking and abusing languages in the classrooms   will make an unhappy situation for both learners and tutors.There should be a divine relationship should be carried out in the classrooms.,Certainly teachers deserve to get  respect.There is talk in the sanskrit language which is matha,pitha,guru,daivam.In this ,quote the presence of the teacher is coming before God.

To conclude,to be a good teacher, he or she has to understand the psychology of students as wells as the students should give immense respect to tutors.This relation will keep the effective learning process in academic institutions."
Most of the urgent problems can only be solved with international cooperation. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is sometimes argued that majority of the urgent problem can solved by globally. I completely agree with the idea.

Nowdays many nation face various kinds of environmental and others problems like health, education and a few number of country's people  join war for save their nation. Educational problem can certainly solved by local government. They are now capable to solve those kinds of easy problem. But environmental and health sector problem is incresing dramatically. Climate change is a global problem and many international organaization work for solved this. Althrough lot of money also invest local othority. But some problem is really huge and totally out of contral. Specially health sector, we see without firstclass country most of the country still suffer on health sector. They have not good facilities and except some nation most country are not capable to produce medicine. So others import medicine from these country. Now covid 19 Corona virus is a dangerous for whole world. Without vaccine and maintaining anty covid 19 instruction we can not overcome from this. This type of urgent problem is impossible to solve individually. So World Health Organaization others developped country try to helped for overcome that problem. On the other hand, some problem are related to politics. For example some nation are involved with war for liberation. This type of problem only can solved by globally. Besides, in many countries terorists also increased and they are really dangerous. So for make this world peaceful we should work globally. 

In conclusion, most of the country not capable to handle some big problem without help of international cooperation and all most all urgent problem only can solved globally because individual have no ability."
Most of the urgent problems can only be solved with international cooperation. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"it is commonly belived that urgent problems can be solved only with internaational collaboration and coordination.i agree to probllems can be solved by international involment,
there are lot of issues a country face during its journet-y towards develoment and stablity.while achiveing the stage of bieng stable each and every country entertained itself with international help and collaboratioon.without this a country could not achive the targets and goals which are highly demanding and withouts these a country will never get throgh a hard situations.eg a country having floods anually would be in intense need of funds and resources from other countries otherwise it will be unable to coup with the demands.

"In the past, people stored knowledge in books. Nowadays people stored knowledge on the Internet. Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?","In recent years,  it has been witnessed the augmenting advancement of technology incessantly and the advent of cutting-edge technology by every passing day. Earlier books were the only source of knowledge but now people are sharing their experience on the Internet as it becomes an easy method of conveying the message and more convenient as compared to reading a book. I believe the benefits of it outweigh the drawbacks.

To begin with, Reading a book requires a lot of time and effort such as carrying it along with oneself.Substituting this with a mobile phone or tablet with an Internet connection is more beneficial.On the Internet one can find unlimited study material and even they can store it in Clouds which are either free of cost or charges a small monthly fee. Furthermore, it is easy to access the internet due to its user-friendly platform. This also eliminates the weight we carry for books. All the books can be stored on a single palm-sized screen. Moreover, the sharing of material on the internet is easier. For example, one can share their documents with friends and family by just sending the link.

On the other hand, there are some disadvantages as well. Learning something on bright screens affect the eyes of the reader. According to a survey , more  people gets affected by eye-sight problems after sitting in front of desktops. 

In conclusion , after deliberating the boon and bane of the Internet for storing  knowledge. Although there are repercussions of selecting a digital platform over paperback still the advantages outweigh the disadvantages."
More and more people decide to eat healthy food and exercise regularly. What are the reasons for this trend? What can be done to encourage more people to eat healthier and exercise?,"Many people choice the trend to eat nutritious food and gain the physical activity routinely. In this essay, I will discuss what the causes people to do this trend, and how the people can do to embrace society to decide healthy food for their daily intake and exercise.

To begin with, every people want to avoid the chronic desease in the future by eat healthy food and do sport regularly. Besides genetic factor, the most biggest risk factor people get that deseases because of their lifestyle when they were young. For instance, to prevent ourselves from diabetes mellitus, we have to avoid food or snacks that are much contain of sugar and carbohydrates, and we do jogging at least an hour for twice a week. As a results, in the future people will live healthier without any desease although the getting older. They can still do the same activities like when they were young and live happily with their family.

In addition, society realize that healthy life increase their performance in their daily activities. Many researches report that balance nutrition and sport enhance the body metabolism. So it fully support body organs and tissues to produce some energy to the brain and physical activity in the workplace. As a consequence, the people not easy to tired and always have a stamina for their perfomance. Besides, they more creative and to do their best on daily activities. 

Furthermore, to influence more people to decide life healthily, campaigning in the social media is the one of the effective way to promote the benefits to eat healthy food and do exercise. By the simple information and supporting with audio visual in their smartphone, people will attract and curious to follow it. For example, we put information how to read nutrition facts in snack packages correctly in the instagram. Besides, youtube vlogger who concern in sport, make simple video tutorial for burning fat exercise in the home. So, the people have the simple but informative tutorial to choice the healthy way for their life.

In sum, people will follow the good trend by eat healthy food and do exrcise regularly. Indeed, it will be increase their good quality of life in health in the future."
More and more people decide to eat healthy food and exercise regularly. What are the reasons for this trend? What can be done to encourage more people to eat healthier and exercise?,"Recently, the number of people who take nutritious food and do physical activity is increasing. In this essay, I will explain why they motivated and suggest solutions to push ahead with this trend.

One of the possible reasons for this trend is that accurate health information became easier than ever before. With the development of technology, people can obtain plenty of information, such as the relevance between good health and lifestyle. For example, on the internet, people can find articles about obesity and depression, which are caused by the excessive intake of junk food and a lack of work out. Besides, many articles provide how to cook nutritional meals. Easily access to fitness and cuisine information led people to reconsider their eating and workout habits, thus, more people tend to eat healthier and doing physical activity on daily basis to avoid getting illnesses.

By adding the opportunity of learning about cooking and exercise, the number of people who follow this trend will more increase and encourage them to continue for a long time. Experts like registered dietitians and sports instructors can teach an effective way and new methods that most people would not know. For instance, the city where I live has well-reputed yoga lessons for its convenience, which do different forms from the past ones. Citizens can join that whenever they want and will never get bored since every lesson varies. Therefore, setting an affordable environment that includes beneficial advice will encourage more people to consume balanced meals and doing work out.

To sum up, much health information led people to eat nutritious meals and doing physical activity daily. In my opinion, offering an opportunity which people can learn about cooking and exercising without hesitation will propel them even more."
Some people think that too much attention and too many resources are given to the protection of wild animal and birds. Do you agree or disagree?,"In recent times, people hold conflicting views about whether authorities spend too much money and labor on protecting endangered animals and birds. I am convinced that the efforts the government uses for this purpose are sufficient and this essay serves to make it clear.

First of all, the protection of wild animals and birds plays an important role in the future survival of humans. The research of protecting animals brings several benefits, each kind of species has their own particular ability, which scientists can find out and research deeply if this ability has a superior potential in the living standard of humans such as healthcare. Hence, the existence of these animals may be an anticipation for humans' future to avoid some disasters such as pandemics, for instance, when ice in Antarctica and the North Pole will melt and release several unknown ancient viruses or epidemics. To solve this risk, scientists can find new vaccines by carrying out many experiments with a diverse range of animals like the way these creatures respond to an epidemic or new vaccines before being used for humans.

Moreover, the conservation of a wide range of animals is another way to protect biodiversity, humans' habitats, and natural resources. Many daily activities of wild creatures have a vital correlation with the growth of special herbs or rare trees, which are used for several purposes such as medical materials. For example, simply, the relationship between bees and mints is win to win, the daily activities of the bees stimulate flowers to grow rapidly with better quality, and a leaf of mints is a key element for sore throat medicine. Thus the conservation of wild animals and birds is another method to protect and improve the standard of humans' life.

In conclusion, the resources consumed for the protection of wild creatures and birds are sufficient, these efforts are like an investment for the preparation of disaster in the future and improve the living standard of citizens."
Fewer young people choose to work in farming. What are the reasons? Should young people be encouraged to do farming work?,"More and more youngsters are now refusing to have a career in Agriculture. In this paragraph, I will analyze the reasons for this phenomenon and answer the question of whether the young generation should be encouraged to participate in the work of a farmer.

With the booming of technology development, the world that we are living in has become more and more advanced , creating a better living conditions and people, especially the youngsters are becoming too attached with these comfortable and convenient lifestyle. This is the main reason why young people tend to avoid working in the agriculture sector because of its effort and hard-work. Another reason that can not be ignored is that a lot of young people have a firm belief that a career of a farmer has no prospect, fortune and opportunity in comparison with other jobs. 

Due to the lack of young labor in the agriculture sector, many people have raised the question of whether more youngsters should be encouraged to do farming work. In my opinion, I strongly agree with this statement due to the fact that the importance of farming should not be ignored by people at a young age. Let aside all arguments, it can clearly be seen that agriculture is one of the most pivotal industries in our world. A huge amount of food that people consume daily comes from farming, and also the huge amount of income that agriculture creates can not be overlooked. Therefore we should raise the awareness of young people about the importance of agriculture as well as why they should participate in the farming work."
Machines are replacing humans in the manual workforce. Do you think the positive effects outweigh the negative effects?,"In our rapidly changing world, an increasing number of tasks that were traditionally performed by humans are now being handled by machines. This shift raises questions  about whether the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages. In my opinion, however, despite there are few drawbacks, the benefits of machines taking over human tasks are indeed far more.

The advantages of machines performing human tasks are multifaceted.  Firstly, automation signifactly enhances productivity and efficiency. Machines can operate without fatigue,maintain consistent precision, and complete tasks at much more faster rate than humans. This is evident in manufacturing, where automated assembly lines have revolutionized production, reducing human errors, increasing output, and improving product quality.

Furthermore, machines excel in handling dangerous and monotonous tasks, thereby reducing human exposure to hazardous environments. For instance, robots are widely employed in bomb disposal and in exploring extreme conditions, such as space and deep-sea exploration. This not only safeguards human lives but also facilitates the collection of valuable data.

Nonetheless, the transition towards automation is not without challenges, including potential job displacement and the dehumanization of work. As machines become more capable and efficient, certain jobs become obsolete, leading to unemployment and necessitating the acquisition of new skills. Moreover, the overreliance on machines can erode the human touch and creativity in  some work settings, potentially affecting job satisfaction and mental well-being."
The only way to improve safety on our roads is to give much stricter punishments for driving offenses. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Considering the great number of traffic accidents despite numerous rules issued by the governments, many people believe that intensifying the penalties is the utmost solution to secure the safety of their citizens on the roads. Although the idea is justifiable, I believe there are more methods to solve the problems.

On the one hand, it is true that stringent laws for people can improve road safety and mitigate traffic incidents. The fact that one of the main reasons for one's deliberate neglect driving on the roads and more risks of traffic accidents is the loose punishments for simple cases of traffic violation. That is why they tend to underestimate the cost of their violation, thinking their action is trivial to cause any harm. And they are more likely to break the same rule again.  Therefore, if the level of penalty can be raised higher to the point that drivers have to struggle to pay, they will pay stricter attention on the roads to avoid violating the codes. For example, in Vietnam, the minimum penalty for each time blowing the red light is around 200 000 VND for motorbike users and 4 million VND for car drivers. With this difference, motorbikers are prone to go against the regulations more frequently than car owners. 

However, the proposal is not optimal as stricter traffic codes may not work effectively for irresponsible drivers and should be combined with other measures to promote better driving habits. As there are always dwellers who are rebellious to break the rules no matter how strict they are, the authorities had better come up with other solutions for the problems. One suggestion is to encourage people to use public transportation to reduce the number of vehicles on the roads. Another approach is to launch frequent advertising campaigns regarding transportation posted on different platforms such as billboards, and social media apps to raise the commuters’ awareness of driving safely and abiding by the regulations. Hence, the combination of these methods can create more desired results than relying on only one. 

In conclusion, it is undeniable that more severe punishment for driving offences can improve road safety. However, there are still other effective methods that can be taken into consideration for governments to achieve safety targets."
The only way to improve safety on our roads is to give much stricter punishments for driving offences. What extent do you agree or disagree?,"In recent days, the Government set new rules to avoid road accidents. Some people believe stricter punishments for driver offences are the only way to improve road safety. I completely disagree with this statement. stricter punishment may reduce road accidents but it's not the only way. In this essay, I will discuss how other effective ways like good infrastructure, regular vehicle maintenance and awareness  improve road safety.

Firstly, Good roads might  avoid road accidents. If the government provides infrastructure like good roads, traffic lights, and speed breakers in right place, there is a high chance to avoid road accidents. For instance, UK authority well maintains their roads which reduce 20% of road accidents  every year. Likewise, regular vehicle maintenance helps to avoid road accidents. a person who drives a vehicle in the bad condition  face difficulties during driving which may lead to  severe accidents. The government set regulations to check the vehicle condition  every year might avoid this kind of accidents. For example, In India authorities should check the vehicle condition every year and provide an FC certificate, a person who drives a vehicle without an FC certificate should be punished.

Furthermore, the Administration set an awareness campaign about  road accident for  people may give more responsibility to  societies. communities had a lack of awareness about  road safety.Government should advertise the importance of wearing helmets as well as a seat belts to the people. For example, In 2016, Bajaj company set a campaign and they told how many  bikers are dead on highways because of not following the road rules.

In conclusion, punishment for the driving offence is one of the way to improve road safety but it's not the only way. Authorities also take responsibility to improve road safety."
The only way to improve road safety is to give much stricter punishments on driving offenses. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Gaining high driving criteria can be obtained by forcing drivers to pass regular safety courses, while some people come to the terms with the fact that it would be more effective to scare drivers with stricter penalties. I firmly believe that it would be more effective to charge drivers for breaking a driving law rather than enrolling in regular basis driving courses.

On the one hand, the proponents of taking regular driving courses think these courses as a civilized way to reach this aim. As most individuals have learned a wide range of knowledge at school or at university, it would not be strange that they are able to learn this matter in an institute. In addition, people should be trained before driving and have to acquire a driving licence for it. Therefore, they can learn the necessary rules by taking courses and it would be a more civilized way to reach this intention.

On the other hand, some people believe that stricter punishments may play a key role in this sense. They think that people will not comply with a rule unless there is a penalty for committing it.

Punishments were always tools for authorities to reign in  a county or control bad habits in societies. Furthermore, statistics reveal that people are more sensitive when they are about to lose money or go to prison. Consequently, by presenting more excruciating sentences for bad drivers, the governments may receive  their desired result sooner.

In conclusion, I believe that harder punishments could be more effective than just making drivers  pass regular precautionary driving classes. Additionally, I suggest that besides severe punishments it would be useful for the governments to hold some courses for the drivers who have an accident more that the normal ones."
Some people think that the only way to improve safety on our roads is to give much stricter punishments on driving offences. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some individuals believe that the only way to enhance road safety is to increase punishments for drivers. I disagree with this view because many drivers may still violate the driving rules when they receive a chance even though the penalty is high and educating their mindset could be another possible way to solve this issue.

It is true to say that  a large number of drivers  break safety rules whenever they obtain a chance. Although governments and authorities are used to control the most sophisticated equipment , many of them are not interested to follow those laws because in their opinion some rules are not relevant and impractical. Moreover, some traffic police are also intended to charge a high amount of money to drivers rather than educating them . In Thailand , for example ,  larger numbers of drivers are paying  money to traffic police instead of obeying the laws and that could lead to the  corruption problem as well. Unless governments are taking serious action ,  public road safety could not expect to get better.

Undoubtedly , educating is more effective than punishing if we want to improve road safety.Obviously , changing the public mindset is not an easy task because governments and authorities might need to invest a large amount of time and money as well. Even though the investment is huge , we could receive better outcomes like fewer road accidents . In the UK, for instance, a wide range of educating  roads safety awareness and guidelines can reduce a significant amount of accidents in some major cities .

To conclude,even though some people say that  more punishments for careless drivers can improve road safety , a lack of proper education  can  still remain this problem in the future. Unless  we educate the public , we would not resolve the problem."
The only way to improve the safety of our roads is to give much stricter punishments on driving offenses. What extent do you agree or disagree?,"Road safety is a very important and concerning matter. Carelessness while driving can lead to severe accidents. Therefore, the only way to improve the safety of our roads is to give much stricter punishments for driving offences. According to my perspective, I completely agree with administering severe penance for any kind of recklessness or irresponsibility on the streets as any mistake can cause someone to lose his or her life. In the essay, I will discuss the reason that lead to accidents and why severe penalizing is necessary for such delinquency.

 Firstly, punctuality is a major reason for mishaps on the highways. To put it more simply, people speed on the highways and break traffic rules when they are getting late to reach their destination. To illustrate, suppose a man needs to reach work by 8 but he started off late from home. So now to get to the office quickly he will break the speed limit which is very dangerous and can create disasters any moment he loses control. He might injure himself badly or even worse die.

 Secondly, drunk driving also originates tragedies on highways. Often youngsters drink and drive which results in them losing control and crashing into something else. It is very concerning as it can severely injure someone or even worse take someone's life. Likewise, teenagers speed on the tracks as being part of a racing competition or just for fun or adventure which is unacceptable because all of this promotes mishaps.

 To conclude, folks have a very casual attitude towards traffic laws. They are more prone to breaking them despite the fact that it can save their lives. Hence as mentioned earlier in the essay, I hold the view that the only way for the betterment of road safety is to administer severe penance on speeding offences on the streets as nothing is more important than life."
THE ONLY WAY TO IMPROVE ROAD SAFETY IS TO GIVE MUCH STRICTER PUNISHMENTS ON DRIVING OFFENCES. TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU AGREE OR DİSAGREE?,"In the last few years, the debate regarding road safety has been raised. Some people claim that the only way to increase  road security is to have strict rules and punishment systems. However, I believe that such measures will not be enough and we need more actions to tackle this problem. 

Firstly, the government should have the responsibility for ensuring that the country has a safe route according to the standards. For example, in the major cities, we should have huge roads then small network routes. In addition, roadway maintenance should occur frequently in order to avoid accidents. Furthermore, we should have a national roads safety committee that will inspect and standardize the traffic safety issues. For instance, the committee will give guidelines to be followed as well as training to the inspectors to monitor the progress. 

Secondly, the government also needs to make clear traffic rules and distribute them to the people. In other words,  theoretical knowledge should be included in driving lessons. In addition, such knowledge should be distributed to all roads users. Thirdly, the presence of traffic lights is essential to allow smooth movements of the vehicles. All of that together with a strict punishment system will decrease  accidents and promote roads safety. 

In conclusion, to decrease the accidents and make sure the security of motor traffic, cyclists and pedestrians we should have excellent roads as well as a formal committee that responsible for the guidelines. In addition to a strict fines system. Also,  a theoretical exam should take place for all driving students."
The only way to improve safety of our roads is to give much stricter punishments on driving offenses. What extent do you agree or disagree?,"Traffic safety measures have long been on the government’s agenda worldwide. Some people argue that to make road travel safer, government has to punish drivers more harshly if they break the traffic law. I agree with the view  that punishment can help curb road offenses, but it should not be taken as the only solution.

Admittedly, a severe punishment is vital considering its deterrent effect on those who are likely to disobey road regulations. For example, Australia is one of the safest countries all over the world. In this country, traffic violators are fined more  seriously than some other countries. An instance is drivers will be detained if they are found to have drunk driving and a severe fine will be applied for over speeding rather than just verbal warning in some other places. Therefore, drivers and pedestrians become more aware of traffic laws and demonstrate improved law compliance, since they know the serious consequences of their risky actions.

However, despite the importance of imposing harsh regulations, the authorities should not overlook other options that may sometimes achieve better outcomes. One salient example is that raising the legal driving age could contribute to the improvement of road safety. It is seen that youths are legally allowed to drive after 16 or 17 in some countries, such as Philippines and United Kingdom. However, teenagers are usually more impetuous but less mature than adults,

hence are more likely to disobey the traffic regulations. As a result, increasing the legal driving age to 21.5 in countries with high traffic accident rates could enhance young people’s awareness of traffic law since they have more time for training.

In conclusion, the apparent effectiveness of the harsher punishment measures on traffic law offenders should be acknowledged. However, this is not the only way that achieves better and safer usage of roads. An integrated approach should be adopted such as raising the legal driving age."
"The only way to improve road safety is to give much stricter punishments on driving offenses. To what extent do you agree or disagree? 
","People have different views on how to improve road safety. While I accept that implementing harsher punishments can help solve this situation, I strongly disagree that this is the only measure because there are alternative ways which are effective and need taking into account.
On the one hand, it is undeniable that stricter punishments could deter motorists from driving dangerously and carefully. The full weight of law should be applied in imposing a variety of non-custodial sentences such as heavy fines and the confiscation of driving licenses. Furthermore, for serious offenders such as driving while intoxicated should serve a prison sentence, because they endanger innocent lives. As a result, it is undoubted that people are less likely to commit a driving offence because of those harsher penalties.
On the other hand, I would believe that there are several measures that can effectively improve the road safety. Firstly, national and local authorities can help tackle this problem by installing speed camera. This, consequently, could raise the awareness of people about the need to follow the speed limits. In addition, regular vehicle inspections should be conducted, which can play a significant role in reducing the number of accidents caused by mechanical failures. Finally, people should be offered better education about the importance of road safety, especially young people who are more likely to break the rules. This, therefore, could make individuals adhere to the driving rules.
In conclusion, I would maintain that strict penalties are not the only way to improve this situation, and they should be implemented along with other steps to completely tackle the road safety issue.

Some believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots. What is your opinion?,"With the developing technology, the innovation of artificial intelligence has not only dramatically changed our lifestyles but also highly increased life standards. Some works become to be altered by artificially intelligent robots, which are programmed to tackle with either simple questions or complex problems. It is believed that these robots will do all kinds of jobs in the end, but I do not hold the same idea as that.

To begin with, it is admittedly that artificial intelligence is likely to make lives more convenient, and make several jobs much easier to complete in efficiency. Firstly, these programmed robots are able to avoid human mistakes, such as car accidents caused by uncareful drivers. A concrete example is Tesla, a company which produces self-driving cars. Secondly, employers may benefit from these artificially intelligent robots. To illustrate, it is possible that highly repeated works done by humans before will be replaced by robots in the future. With this, employers may have opportunities to cut budget on salaries, and focus on funding other topics, such as R&D and advertisements.

However, despite the beneficial effects that robots can bring, I still suggest that robots cannot take all jobs. There are careers that the artificial intelligence can never achieve the capacity to do it. For example, we can hardly substitute robots for teachers, because they may be unable to find out children’s emotions. Furthermore, tasks that need to be judged by humans cannot be replaced by robots, neither. To sum up, jobs require emotion and intuition will still be done by the human race.

In conclusion, although artificially intelligent robots are likely to supersede unskilled works and decrease mistakes, there are still a lot of works that need human touch to complete. So I believe that only several jobs will be done by robots."
"21.Nowadays, more and more jobs and tasks which involve hard physical work are done by machines. Do the positive effects of this trend outweigh the negative effects?","Indeed, the modern world is moving in a direction where more routine tasks are performed by machines. While this trend is welcomed by many, I would say that we should not be overly optimistic about it, given its detrimental effects on individuals and society.

On the surface, the trend toward automation seems to be benefiting the world in every way. On a personal level, this trend frees many people from mundane tasks and allows them to do something more meaningful. For example, when mechanized farming frees farmers from tasks such as planting and ploughing, they can spend more time and energy focusing on market prices and sales. Additionally, entrepreneurs care most about the increase in productivity and efficiency brought about by the wide application of machines. However, in my opinion, these benefits mentioned above should be considered from the opposite perspective. Firstly, the era of mechanization not only failed to liberate people from secular labour but also witnessed the demise of many handicrafts and traditional skills.

Even further, as handcrafted items are replaced by faceless uniform products on the assembly line, it is even more frustrating to us that there is a lack of diversity and richness in national identities and cultures worldwide. This is because a nation's culture, customs, and spirit are inextricably linked to its traditional handicrafts. Another problem that cannot be ignored is the ensuing unemployment problem. While the manufacturing industry is enjoying the dividends of robots replacing labour, millions of workers are unemployed. This is unacceptable for any government.

In conclusion, I would say that industrialization should not come at the expense of traditional skills or unemployment."
Only 20% of Tech Jobs are Held by Women. What problems do women face that prevent them from getting these jobs and what must be done to change this situation.,"Only 20% of tech jobs are held by women is a problem becoming more widespread in many parts of the world. There are several problems caused by this trend, and various solutions could be taken to improve the situation.

There are a variety of different problems with this phenomenon. To begin with, we can see that the biggest barrier is cultural, 71% of women report having worked in a tech company with a strong “bro culture” (TrustRadius). Considering culture fit is one of the criteria for hiring people, this kind of environment is a barrier itself for technologist women’s employability. Another significant problem to mention is that the overtime culture, unmanageable workloads, and unrealistic deadlines can be part of a common part of a tech professional’s day-to-day, leading to high levels of burnout. For example, the pace of change in the tech industry means that mothers taking maternity leave, taking a career break for even a few months may return to work to find their expertise outdated.

Despite these circumstances, there are several solutions that companies and individuals could take to solve the problems. Firstly, a simple solution would be to companies balance the number of women in the team and give them opportunities to ascend job roles, the culture fixes itself. When young girls start to see a growing number of women in tech, they’ll believe they belong to the tech field too and will start opting more for studying STEM subjects. The second measure would be for individuals to need to overcome barriers and difficulty in work to adapt to the culture in the companies. Finally, the industry can begin to close the pay gap, improve its retention of female talent, and create a more equal community where every woman is empowered to thrive in her career.

In conclusion, the problem of only 20% of tech jobs being held by women is unlikely to be entirely eliminated in the short term. However, various actions can be taken to tackle the issue to reduce the effects / impact it is having on the current society."
Some believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots. What is your opinion?,"In all countries around the globe armed police personnel are common. However, the necessity of arming them is debatable. Some people claim that it leads to the unprecedented attack on common people and perhaps to state terrorism and violence, while I concur with the side of those who argue that it is essential to maintain law and order. The reasons are manifold for my support  will be discussed in this essay. 

On the one hand, I totally disagree with the notion that state terrorism is raising because of armed police officers. In fact, many people who believe this notion are not ready to understand the fact that the police department is directly controlled by the home department of government. And thus there are myriad public councils are working to strictly monitor the judicial use of these weapons by police officers. Additionally, these people often come with an example of some random police encounters with common people. Although these incidents are true, I believe these are mostly accidental and the police officers who are responsible for these also have been punished severely for their negligence. 

On the other hand, the country's entire internal security management is under the control of the police department. In order to maintain these superiorly, they are in the need to develop some sort of fear among people. This fear in my opinion is healthy for the betterment of society. Furthermore, police and state security forces are the first-line workers who need to witness some dangerous situations. Despite their personal well-being, they work towards the welfare and security of the people. For example, recently one of the police inspectors in my neighbourhood was brutally attacked by some petty thieves during a situation when he tried to arrest them for shoplifting. This incident made me  think in favour of armed police officers that if he was allowed to carry his weapon, he would have got prevented  the attack. 

In conclusion, not only do armed police officers use their weapons to maintain law and order, but also for their self-protection. Therefore, I totally agree that arming  police officers will never lead to state terrorism or violence, in fact, it prevents these."
"Many jobs used to be done at home by hands but nowadays, increasing number of them are done by machines instead. Discuss advantages and disadvantages of this.","In the modern era , a number of work was done by  machine ,on the contrary, it did by people  the people so this essay explores the disadvantages of this statement.

First of all , numerous people left their jobs due to the advanced technology and become unemployed , for example , a single machine does the same work as 10 people  , consequently , they lost their  task , owing to the technology and without it , they feel like handicapped.

Moreover , it impacts  their family budget and facing an economic crisis for the reason that they left the workshop , for instance , nowadays ,  farming technology become popular rather than in the past , as a result , labour cannot get work to do farming in the field. Furthermore , most  the things are not too good as compared with handmade items , due to  some reason , for instance , there are lots of  differences between those made by machines and people.

On the other hand , it can fulfil the demand of items , due to get thousands of things in a minute , it works fast rather than individual , for instance , many objects which takes time when it made by people , on the contrary , while machines established in just a minute. Secondly , these types of thing is available in a very cheap range due to the material , for instance , they only focus on stock so that they use low material to produce it , consequently , everyone can purchase it and they can meet their needs.

In conclusion , both are important to the development of a country's economy so we can not avoid any single thing but the government should work on the handmade businesses to establish them."
"Many university graduates cannot find a job in their chosen profession.
What factors may have caused this situation and what, in your opinion, should be done about it.
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Many students upon completion of their studies contend that their unable to find an occupation relevant to their chosen field. In my opinion, ,,currently this is a major issue for the students as they become unemployed after they are out of university. 

First of foremost, after school examinations many students fail to research  the trending occupations relevant to each industry without receiving or gathering more information regarding the preferred job, ,,instead they choose the wrong path. Evidence in this matter, an individual who completed her studies in Civil Engineering, has no job opportunities in Sri Lanka. The rationale behind this is that  the chosen occupation is mainly on demand for males than females. Therefore, she then intends to attend university to obtain another qualification for a job that is well in demand such as a marketing course, as certain employers focus on marketing qualifications which additionally consumes time to complete a course. 

As a solution to the stated issue, in my point of view prior to enrolling on a program best option for the individual is to do research on the preferred field. Furthermore, when selecting a course seek  universities that support candidates to find jobs, evidence in this matter is an internship, which helps the student to pursue his/ her chosen career thereafter extend their career and gain the required experience. This will encourage and fascinate the individual to do the best of his/ her ability without facing any problems.

In conclusion, as far as I am concerned the above solution can be measured accurately which then will be less challenging for the student to face unemployment in the future when applying for jobs, without any hesitation."
Many universities graduates cannot find a job in their chosen profession. what factors may have caused this situation and what in your opinion should be done about it?,"Every student who graduates from a Prestigious University wants a job in his/her respective profession. Many of them failed to get their desired Job and eventually they changed their field. There are many reasons for it which I will discuss in this essay.

Firstly, there is a saturation of graduates in the same field and the corresponding jobs are limited. For example, every year almost 2000 chemical engineers are graduated from all the Universities in Pakistan but there are only 500 jobs available for them so what will they do in this situation? Unfortunately, they changed their profession because they do not want to waste one year. However, these kinds of problems exist in almost every country who are producing thousands of graduates with limited job opportunities. According to Higher Education Commission, almost every year 50-70% of graduates changed their profession due to not finding the desired job in their career.

In addition, before selecting the course, students should research very well the scope and saturation of all desired fields. It will not only help them to get a job in their chosen career but also make them morally strong. Government should create more and more opportunities for the graduates so that they do not get dishearted if they can not get a job. In Pakistan, these types of issues can only happen with the engineers because every year thousand of engineers are produced and only 50% of jobs are available for them. 

To conclude, Mostly students after graduation changed their profession because they get failed to find a job in their chosen career. These types of problems can be solved by creating more opportunities for graduates."
"Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots. 
What is your opinion?","With the advancement of ,technology people tend to rely upon many technically advanced equipment, including artificially intelligent robots. However, some people strongly believe that at last all jobs will be done by these things by replacing the human  workforce. I believe that even the technical advancement and reliance on robots make our lives easier, we can't completely rely on these things as mankind.

Especially, in developed countries factories with massive production depend on robots. Actually, these things are very efficient, cost-effective, and smart. Because, in here once we coded them they follow all the instructions without bargaining. Thereby, it is very easy to cover targets on time without any delay. As well as it allows people to reduce their busyness as well as reduce their responsibilities, which help in relaxing them. With the help of artificially intelligent ,robots people would be able to allocate their extra time to other useful things.

However, totally we cannot depend on such kinds of machinery things, because these machines are lack  emotions, rational thinking, decision-making ability, adapting to real-life situations like us. For ,example we cannot replace doctors, nurses, counsellors with robots. Because they especially deal with people's emotions. Moreover, we cannot hold face to face meetings with these artificial gadgets. 

Finally, l would like to say applying the potential of artificially intelligent robots in jobs is important ,however it is better to integrate their capabilities with human knowledge to get a better outcomes."
"Men and women are different in terms of their characteristics and abilities. For this reason, some jobs are better done by men and others by women.
Do you agree or disagree?","It is often argued that situation between male and female who to be able to different kind of workability and characteristics which means some other kind of work position suitable for theirs. I personally agree with this situation. There are two primary reasons is that enormous force and generously emotional.

First of all, all the men seem much stronger than women. Put more simply the ladies couldn't work as gentlemen can in construction. As a ,result if males work in building so that they will earn fascinating salaries. One of the perfect examples of this is so many different work positions is not fit for women such as plumber, aircraft/pilot and car repairmen. in my position ideally for men all these jobs. My closest friend works in the biggest plumber company whom he says for me while is her directes always saying this job isn't to fit for a woman. 

Secondly and even more importantly though women have much more emotional than the opposite sex. That is to say that whatever famelas like other people feeling even their plights, Consequently they are knowing other people without their words. One particularly good example of this is the United States America's one of the biggest statistic ""Women highly talented to teaching skills"" which they capable to communicate children  easier way because they have a natural data so all the women can bear their young ones.

By way of conclusion, I once again restate my view that not only huge strengthens but also high emotional between girls and boys for their characters and job ability"
Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots. What is your opinion?,"In the future, artificially intelligent robots will do all jobs, replacing humans in the workforce. While it is possible that robots will eventually do all exactly repetitive jobs, it is unlikely that jobs that require empathy skills by humans will be taken over. This essay will discuss why people, not replaced by robots, will carry out only some specific jobs.

Robots may do jobs with repetitive and straightforward steps that do not require specific and complex human skills. Many companies have applied artificial intelligence robots into programmable tasks to improve processes instead of hiring and training their employees. In many manufacturing factories, for example, many routine production steps have been replaced by automated solutions run by robots that cost far less than employees. In addition, the automated stations work around the clock and require no holiday or sick leave like the workforce. For these reasons, some suitable jobs that can be suitable by robotic process automation will be replaced.

On the contrary, some human jobs cannot be replaced by robots because artificial robots will never reach the efficient capacity to do them. The jobs that need psychology, education, medical, and social work require human empathy. In undeveloped countries, for instance, uneducated people need social workers to help them relieve their minds. Additionally, when people face fatal health problems, such as cancer, doctors gradually attempt to empathise, parallel with a situation assessment, to their relatives or even directly to patients. Therefore, it is too complicated that robots will be programmed to well complete those jobs instead of humans being.

In conclusion, it is increasingly possible that robots will be gradually replaced most human tasks soon. Robots may entirely complete the unskilled jobs; however, not all jobs are replaced by automated solutions, sophisticated jobs that still need empathy from humans will always exist. Ultimately, the complicated jobs that are required a high-skilled workforce are still safe parallel in the automated solution environment increasing."
"Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with the statement.","In this modern and ever-changing world, the advancement of technology like robotics become more popular and changing the ways people work in many countries. People have different views on this phenomenon. Some people claimed that the high-tech machine will finally take over human’s jobs whereas some people are argued that there will be a lot of jobs humans do humankind tasks which the IA are not capable to complete. Personally, I disagree with the statement because robotics is  are not fully develop enough to cover all the jobs, like Artist, Specialist occupation, and Musician.

It is undeniable that  AI plays an important role in people jobs in many countries. Some people are passionate about technology and easily being trapped by the convenient convenience of high-tech. Moreover, they found it provided their business to save time and money by not employ human humans. For example, producing newspapers and magazines. In the past decade , those tasks were completed by labour which meant the entrepreneurs a company owner employed a human and  have to pay salary monthly In order to run their business smoothly. Another work that people can benefit from using robots is doing house chores, particularly in urban society. Almost everyone is not only occupied by their workload each day but also their precious time with the children and family. Therefore, some people are grateful  and thanks appreciate  the advancement of house chore machines which are valuable for the money as it has helped in terms of saving time and doing boring house works.

On the one hand, On the other hand, /On the contract ,there are several works that are usually being done by humans. First and foremost, Artwork can be the prime example of humankind job that is will never be substituted by Argothrism intelligent procedure because Art is creativity performance from people who have a particular talent in creating  unique Artwork. For instance, The Mona Lisa painting by Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci. Secondly, a specialist job such as Doctor,Civil Engineer, and Lawyer. Those are implemented by people who have a qualified degree to be able to work professionally and communicate with their clients is the most important part while AI robots have are incapable of interaction with humans. Finally, music, as we know can only be produced by men who have had the skill like Michael Jackson who is a very well-known and successful musician in the world.

To summarize, although some people are strongly believed that all  human jobs will be taken over by AI Robots in the near future,there are a number of people who argue and think that there are several occupations that will never be cover replace by the high technology machine.In my point of view, even though some jobs are being done by the machine, nevertheless many specialist occupations which can not perform by the advance Robots."
"EXPERTS BELIEVE THAT, OVER THE NEXT DECADE, ROBOT WILL BE DOING MANY OF THE JOBS CURRENTLY DONE BY HUMANS. DISCUSS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF THIS.","The use of robots not only in the technology industry but also in other industries like the medical and manufacturing fields has increased drastically in the past decade. For instance, nowadays there are robots who can perform surgery, manufacture automobiles and answer calls and respond to clients. So, in my opinion, robots will replace humans in the majority of the jobs presently done by them. This is because robots are more productive than workers as well as make fewer errors. In addition, robots cost lesser to maintain and can benefit an enterprise greatly. 

There are plenty of advantages to automating a job. Firstly, the mechanization of jobs can lead to higher productivity of a company. A study conducted by  Harvard University in 2020, stated that these appliances tended to perform their tasks 40% to 50% faster than people. It can be said that a machine makes fewer mistakes than a human. In short, the advent of machines in the industry can help increase productivity, allowing tasks to be completed faster with fewer errors. Secondly, robots cost much lesser to maintain than workers. A survey conducted by Alphabet incorporation has said that machines are worth six times lesser than humans.This is primarily due to the fact that a robot doesn't need a salary to perform. Hence, it can be said that robots will replace the jobs of one in the coming years. 

In contrast, the automation of a job has its drawbacks as well. The major drawback would be unemployment.In a survey conducted by the New York Times, it was said that automation of jobs would leave 60% to 70% of the population unemployed. Mainly it would affect the unskilled labour force, who rely on these professions to make a living. In summary, unemployment would be a major cause to stress  if the dawn of computerization arrives. Another disadvantage is the fact that equipment is very expensive to buy.Around 30% of companies have stated that while automation is a well worth investment, at the moment it is too expensive. The enterprise has to make sure that it can afford such machines and frequently upgrade them as well. In conclusion, robots tend to be expensive as a result substitution of human jobs does not seem possible. 

In a nutshell, robots can help an enterprise greatly as they offer greater efficiency and low cost of maintenance as compared to humans thus it is believed that robots will replace human jobs. However, to prevent loss of the jobs of individuals, a company must not focus on replacing human professions rather they must focus on integrating both resources to produce maximum benefit."
"Experts believe that, over the next decade, robots will be doing many of the jobs currently done by humans. 
Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this.","Science is moving forward faster than most people can process. Robotics and Artificial Intelligence are a few of the fields that stands out the most, because it can ease the day to day. We could say that Part of a country development can be measure through their technological advances and how it directly affect soceity. 

An advantage that stands out of having robots doing human's jobs is the precision level a field can achieve with its tasks on a daily basis. For instance, medical procedures done with a lasers, which would be thousands of times more precise than an expert doctor's hand. Also on an industrial level, cutting and assambling machines has been optimized by other machines and robots. Another advantage would be the improvement in the time frame to produce goods or deliver tasks, As it has being with car production. For example Ford is known to be the first car company to introduce the assambly line to their production, making it the first company in the USA to produce more cars in less time.

Moving aside all the good it could bring, we must also put in a scale the human capital being compromised due to big industries not needing their skills anymore. Nowadays doing the job of houndreds of people excaving we have very impressive machinery that can do the same job being operated just by one persone in lesser time.  In the other hand, one of the fears of humanity is that Artificial Intelligence could achieve a level of development that might take decisions of its own and reveal against humans.

In conclusion, among all the good things robotics, Artificial Intelligence and technology can bring, we must establish a clear path and goal for our future, so we can combine both human and robots working together, value human capital and work with precision and on time."
"Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots.

What's your opinion?","The progressive rise in replacement of human labour by robots has become debatable in recent times. Intelligent man-made robots are gradually taking over the role of humans in the workforce. While it is likely that unskilled jobs will be done by artificially smart robots in the future, it is most unlikely that professional jobs requiring human contact will be replaced. This essay will discuss why only a few jobs will be done by people eventually.

Machines may end up replacing all menial jobs that do not require specific and complex human skills. In other words, jobs which do not need so much effort or skill will be easily carried out by artificially intelligent robots. The increasing number of companies will prefer the use of machines for unskilled labour because it is less expensive and increases efficiency.This is evident in the United States of America, where 80% of supermarkets have accurately programmed machines at the cashier points. Furthermore, these automated machines reduce human errors with complete elimination of human fatigue. For the above-stated reasons, jobs that can be substituted by robotic intelligence will be replaced in the future.

On the other hand, there are jobs which cannot be taken over by machines because they will never have the capacity to do them. These jobs require a human touch and emotional intelligence. Occupations like medicine, psychology, social work, education, to mention a few. Machines will never be able to achieve what has taken social evolution thousands of years to achieve.

In conclusion,it is increasingly likely that a considerable number of jobs will be substituted by robots. Unskilled labour will eventually be replaced by machines, however, a few human employment requiring human-related skills cannot be overtaken by artificially made robots, Ultimately, a very few human jobs will remain safe in a future with the artificially intelligent workforce."
"SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT EVENTUALLY ALL JOBS WILL BE DONE BY ARTIFICIALLY INTELLIGENT ROBOTS.
WHAT IS YOUR OPINION?","Technology is the main reason for the different changes in  modern reality. Some people think that artificially intelligent robots will do all work in the future. From my point of view, it is impossible that robots can replace a person in all employment sphere. In this essay, I shall elaborate on the reasons for both views on this topic  further.

On the one hand, nowadays it is very difficult to imagine real-life without technologies. Those devices helpful for doing tacks  such as clean up a house, drive a car and so on. However, during the last decades,  robots also have opportunities  to do medicine operations and  collect important information. For instance,  NASA's robots make research on Marc. Therefore, we can unbox fact that the surface of  Marc has  water particles.

On the other hand, the robots are emotionless and  cold machines which can do the task only based on programs. They do not have the ability to make logical decisions or totally understand the feelings of a person. That is why the robot can not replace  the body if he works in the type of job where the worker should support or give life advice. For example, teachers are not only people who help  students to rich  academic  achievements  but also individuals who explain moral normal in the community.

To sum up, I believe that robots make our life more comfortable and easier. However, I confidence that they can not to do all  work for a person.The reasons for that and for  the opposite opinion was demonstrated above."
All jobs can be done equally well by a man and a woman. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"First of all the nature of some occupations exerts vital influence on the gender preference for job holders. Being generally fitter and stronger men have evident advantages over women in physically demanding work. Although recent decades have seen the barricades lifted for females serving in the military and police force in many countries, male soldiers and policemen are still playing various dominant roles simply due to their superiority body strength, endurance and speed on average, particularly for close combats in battlefield or assault, and rescue missions carried out by special forces, By contrast, midwives, as the name suggests, are rarely male professionals not only because of the traditions but also, more importantly, pregnant women’s desire for sexual privacy. 

Even for the occupations that do not show distinct gender preference for the staff, performance still varies from person to person because it largely depends on an individual’s attitudes and abilities rather than sex. Job commitment, for example, is often correlated to a person’s interests, job satisfaction, and life attitude towards the ideal balance between work and family responsibilities, while education and substantial industrial experience affect the necessary expertise for accomplishing the regular tasks of a particular position efficiently. The sexual equality in none of these, however, can be proved by statistical hard evidence across the industries, economic and political systems, and cultures around the world. 

In reality, it is hard to ensure the absolute fairness in performance review. After all not all performance assessments are based on quantitative indexes, such as defect rate, sales and working hours. Quantitative criteria, including the comments from supervisors and peers and customers’ feedback, are often used in modern human resource management in service industry, such as retailing and hospitality, or senior management positions. Many of these are prone to subjective opinions, which could be influenced by factors, such as internal and external interpersonal relationships and personalities"
"Only 20% of Tech Jobs are Held by Women.
What problems do women face that prevent them from getting these jobs and what must be done to change this situation?","Men have dominated job sector since the industrial revolution, despite progress in gender equality. Men still seem to outnumber the women in terms of employment in the tech business. In this essay I shall discuss the issues tossed against women in securing these jobs and changes that need to be put forth to reduce this inequality. 

Regardless of having equal or superior skills to their male counterpart, women often feel societal pressure and cultural norms work against them while seeking jobs. Interviewers question the female applicants about their marital and parental status to understand their personal commitments before offering them the job, hence women are pushed to carefully guard their details in an interview, so they don’t lose out on the job. Additionally, not having a college degree or a computer science graduation tends to lower their confidence at work place or when applying for jobs, because in many cultures’ families encourage men to pursue higher education while women are pushed performed household activities. For instance, in Asian countries people believe that men are the bread winners of the family as well as invest in their education, but on the other hand women are taught to take care of the home and perform domestic work. All these factors make the career path of a woman more challenging.

Many women activists across the globe have brought up this issue to the society and fought gender equality in job market. As a result of this, today, many corporate companies incorporated polices to ensure their workforce have equal number of women and men employed. Other than this IT sector need to diligently transform their corporate culture to respect all employees, moreover make discrimination and gender inequality socially unacceptable. These changes will make the womenfolk feel more secure and boost their morality, thus we can perhaps close the gap between gender disparity.

To conclude, cultural norms need to change in employment and educational settings to permanently eliminate the problem of gender discrimination, so every woman can feel confident, supported and safe as they pursue their dreams."
"Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots.
What is your opinion?","Nowadays, progress in robotics leads to vision that one day robots will replace humans everywhere in workplaces. While it really looks feasible in different factories and construction sectors, but in areas like psychology where it personally varies a lot regarding how to proceed with different cases human still will be the only source of proper solutions. We’re going to review this question closely here to better understand why not all jobs may be performed by robots.

Robots for sure could eventually replace humans in simple service jobs with a few functions. That’s because involving humans into this kind of job is far more expensive than using automated devices with simple algorithms. For example, cashiers, delivery men or even driver functions are already overtaken by robotic solutions. That’s really attractive because robots do not need weekends and extra payment for holidays so it’s cheaper and for sure self-driven cars can go for longer distances without stops. For these reasons that jobs which can be managed by robots will be overtaken by them.

Same time there are some particular jobs requiring special human-specific skills. On basic these jobs are based on high-level mentality skills and kind souls. That's such jobs like psychologist, teacher, doctor and nurses. Robots will never step in this area because of the requirement of deep kindness and humanism. 

It’s quite clear already that robots will end most of human employment. Low skilled positions could be already overtaken everywhere, howeverhowever untouched areas for human personal responsibility and art will still exist. At last only few human jobs will survive in this rising robots workforce appliance."
"men and women are different in terms of their characteristics and abilities. for this reason, their jobs are better done by men and other by women. to what extent do you agree or disagree?","It has been claimed that male and females abilities give them a characteristic to do different types jobs. However, some believe that males have more strength to do hard jobs, while females are more suitable for soft job such as, nurse and teacher. I believe that men have more ability for doing jobs.

First of all, males are more preferred for the hard jobs, which required extreme level of physical power. Thus, men are suitable for construction works as a labor, because physically men are stronger than women. For example, in Canada, more than 90% migrant students get jobs easily at construction sites. Secondly, females are lost their temper easily in the harsh situation, which make the unfit for the highly responsible jobs. While, males adapt themselves according to the situation, they easily tackle problems related at their jobs. Such as, for security jobs, organization usually offered job to male because of their tolerance power.

On the other hand side, there are also some other jobs, which is highly acquired by girls, because of their soft skills. For example, according to a survey in Finland, females get more jobs in teaching profession because of their soft skills, which help them to teach students properly and understand their problems in good way. Moreover, females are also proven the best servant as a nurse; this is because of their caring nature. Last but not least, in this era, where people believed that person’s personality also played a huge role to get success, therefore, girls always get more priority  for front desk jobs where direct interaction with customer required. 

To conclude- I believe that males have more abilities or stamina to do job at construction sites. Whereas, girls are more suitable for in those job, where soft skill and good appearances are must."
"Men and women are different in terms of their characteristics and abilities. For this reason, some jobs are better done by men and others by women.
Do you agree or disagree?","There are a variety of different perspectives on the question of whether or not men and women are equally good at all jobs. Although many people still believe that some kinds of work should only be done by females and other kinds by males, it is my argument that both men and women are able to do any job well. There are two main reason for this.
Firstly, I would argue that traditional ideas about men and women are not always right. It is certainly true that there are characteristics that are typically male and others which are typically female; however, not everybody is typical. Not every woman is physically weak, in the same way that not every man is a poor communicator – traditional gender roles do not fit everybody. A man who wants to do a job normally performed by women or a woman who wants to work in a male – dominated industry should be given the chance to demonstrate his/ her ability.
Furthermore, I feel that having both male and female employees in a workplace creates a sense of balance. The two sexes often, though certainly not always, do things differently. Instead of seeing these differences as weaknesses, I believe that we should view them as chances to find new ways of doing things and thus improve the way we work. Therefore, a person’s weak point can be turned into strengths.
To conclude, for the reasons stated above I maintain that men and women can do any job equally well and that a person’s individual ability is far more important than their sex in this regard."
"Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots. 
What is your opinion?","There are some works that are replace by machines and that is believe by some people. As the technology improves some jobs are being replace by a robot however there are many works that are hard to replace because of the demand of humans’ intelligent. This essay will talk about some possibilities that will occur due to the replacement of robots to human. 
Nowadays, Information technology are becoming advance and by this many inventions, machines are made to replace people in their work place. Many companies are developing their equipment for them to reach their target market. For instance, some companies prefers to buy machines that works faster that a human to do the task in their institutions. In this case many people will be unemployed because of this circumstances. 
On the other hand, there are many works that are needed to be supervise properly that a robot cannot do. There are many situations that must be done with gentle and care. For example, medicines must be carefully made because of its sensitivity. Same with the production of machines many parts are gently attach into its positions. Robots itself cannot make its own that it still need   the hand of a human being. 
The increasingly demand of many jobs that replaced by a robot is highly recommended. However, with the work of this non-living things some production can be in risky situation. Therefore, humans are more suitable in any work because of their unconditionally care to the products. They can also determine the errors easily due to some instinct that a machines do not have"
Some believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots. What is your opinion?,"Artificial intelligence is the trending technology right now across the world. Some people believe that eventually this technology will be used to develop robots which will replace all human jobs. I disagree with this statement, and will explain my viewpoint in this forthcoming paragraph in detail.

Firstly, to define artificial intelligence, it's a technology which replaces the human intelligence with a machine learned programmatic language. Technically speaking each and every job that is done by a human being could be converted to a programmable command and learnt by a machine to perform. To exemplify, self driving cars developed by Tesla are considered as robots. With several years of learning experiences and proper logic, the cars are programmed to drive safely. Having these kind of technological advancements, we can say a majority of the human jobs can be performed by robots.

However, the human brain has tremendous intelligence power with several emotional quotients which cannot be fully replaced by artificially intelligent robots. Furthermore, cognitive ability that a human mind possesses can only sense the importance and criticality of the job and take a wise decision. For instance, a Psychiatric Doctor will be able to understand the mental situation of a patient with relevant questions and the most authentic response received from patients.

To summarize, artificial intelligent robots might replace a majority of jobs going forward. However, it cannot replace the human touch that sense the emotional perspectives of some jobs. Moreover,  this programme needs a continuous maintenance and monitoring to perform for which a human being is mandatory."
"some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots.
what is your opinion.","Modern technology has entred each and every field thesedays. In the future, all  jobs will be  done by robots as this trend incresing day by day that robots taking place of people in different jobs. I reckon that robots will deffinitly replace the humen one day.
To embark with, ample of reasons are there that sport the view that in future jobs done by robots only. Firstly, humen wants more relaxation in life and avoid doing any type of work , therefore in upcoming period they ignore there work and would hire robots to complete their tasks. To ellustrate, remote control cars would be used and people just sit in cars and  they no need to hire any driver to drive a car.
Addmitdly, in cutting edge era, no anyone has enthusiasm to do certain tasks due to unhealthy lifestlye, so people require robots to complete work as they will be unable to do anything due health issues that they confront in future as a result of incleasing pollution .
To conclude, i would like to say that in future robots definitly will take place of human to do jobs."
"Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificial intelligent jobs.
What is your opinion?","Dependency on artificially intelligent robots, to carry out tasks, substantially increase in the future. Although it is possible that artificially intelligent robots will substitute human workforce to a great extent, there are jobs that require human relationship will not be replaced. This essay will discuss why robots are more preferred to carry out most of the jobs.
Robots will eventually carry out all easy and less complex jobs. Many employers believe that robots are reliable, less expensive rather than hiring and training of human labours. Machine produces more output because they donot feel fatigue or any other kinds of stresses, which may affect the efficiency of any human. In one of the largest food chain restaurant in India, for example, many waiters are been replaced with Ipads that cost less than hiring. For above foresaid reasons era of machines will overshadow jobs.
Conversely, we seldom give thought to ponder over that some jobs require more complex skills, emotions and particular relationships are impossible to perform by any robot. First and foremost is human posses many characteristics to outperform few particular jobs by building trust and long lasting relationship. But simply, some jobs require a ‘human touch’. For instance, a independent research conducted by teleshoping marketing company that sales executive over phone are more effective than artificial intelligent answering machines. Robots will never achieve the capacity what social evolution has taken place in hundreds of years.
In conclusion, the growing number of robots in workplaces will consume most of human employment. It is irrefutable that robots will eventually do all unskilled work; however , complicated jobs required specific human set skills will still exist. Ultimately, due to limitations of robots some human jobs are safer."
"Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots.

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.","Artificially intelligent robots are progressively replacing humans in the workforce. While it is possible that all menial jobs will eventually be done by robots, it is unlikely that jobs that require human contact will be taken over. This essay will discuss why eventually only few jobs will be carried out by people."
some believe that eventually all jobs will be done by arifically intelligence robots.  opinion,"Some jobs are already done by robots. However, I do not believe that all jobs will eventually be performed by such devices for several reasons. Robots are expensive and incapable of doing certain jobs that require special skills. Government regulations will also prevent their large scale deployment.

If a man can do a job as well as a robot, I see no justification for replacing the man with a robot. Robots are suitable for certain jobs, but they have plenty of limitations too. To begin with, the cost of operating and maintaining robots is extremely high. This is a great reason for employers to continue to prefer humans over robots. For example, the cost of installing a robot in a Khartoum-based supermarket was around one million U.S. dollars. The robot will require decades to deliver services worth its cost. Furthermore, in order to keep these devices working continuously, companies will have to employ skilled operators. This will further increase their cost of operation and make human workers indispensable in the labour market.

There are also certain jobs that require the human touch. For instance, robots cannot do a good job in sectors like medicine, engineering or social service because of their inability to understand human feelings, needs and wants. Unemployment is another factor that discourages the deployment of robots on a large scale. If robots are deployed in all sectors people will lose their jobs. As we already know, unemployment has an adverse effect on the society. To prevent this situation, the government may also bring about legislation that requires companies to employ humans instead of robots.

To sum up, robots may be getting smarter; however, in my opinion, they will never completely replace humans in the workplace. Of course, there are sectors where only robots can be employed. In other sectors, humans will continue to be employed."
"Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificial intelligence (AI) robots.
What is your opinion?","In this era of smart technology some people are concerned that sooner or later the artificially
intelligent programs and machines will take care of all the jobs which are now done by humans. In this context, I believe, on one hand, not all but a big portion of the jobs will be done by artificially enhanced machines, on the other hand, lots of new jobs will be created simultaneously that requires human touch. This essay will discuss why all the jobs will not be taken over by robots.

The robots or computer programs will mostly replace the repetitive and structured jobs. Jobs such as data entry, listing and filing office works, order fulfilling, answering calls, creating work schedules etc. non-decision making and mundane, but very structured jobs will be replaced by machines to reduce cost and enhance productivity. For instance, Amazon UK has created several smart retail stores without any cashier by making the payment completely online and automated. Hence, artificially intelligent machines will hopefully take care of these unskilled to semi-skilled jobs that do not demand any strategic decision making or complex thought process.

Although there are still so many jobs that demands emotional intelligence that only a human being can provide. To accomplish numerous jobs human touches, such as using gut feeling or intuition to make decisions, interpersonal skills, negotiation skills and other emotional attributes are needed that cannot be completed by robots. For example, to convince a client to close a business deal in good terms needs a physical human being, where good interpersonal skills and some specific emotional intelligence come in play which the machines would never be able to replace. Therefore, many new jobs will be created in future, which will need more human feelings and emotions to get the works done properly.

In conclusion, I believe, on one hand, many routine and too much repetitive jobs will be lost to the robots. While a lot of other jobs are there and many more will be created where a human participation and emotional intellect are a paramount to get it done."
Advertisements are becoming more and more common in everyday life. Is it a positive or negative development?,"It is rather often that businesses have to endure the cut-throat competition for attracting customers and for increasing sales as well. In order for their products to either stand out from the crowd or to emphasis how unique their products are, companies usually use advertising as a tool attracting customers. In my opinion, marketing and branding strategy for boosting sales by means of advertising new and unique features of a product is mostly negative development.

Most of the brands if not all claim their product to be the most fascinating which suits to the customers’ needs with new features in the market. They do so to create a positive impression to the consumers to increase their sales and profitability while also staying ahead of their competitors. For instance, the advertisements on TV for products like shampoo, soaps or body lotion proclaim their products having the best ingredients and, in addition to that, consist of something new that their counterparts lack of. They may even outdo their old products by adding new flavour or a new vitamin claiming that their new product is the best ever. Obviously, this is a marketing strategy boosting sales and profitability creating a craving between the consumers for their products at the same time.

As the new features which the businesses advertise are nothing novel, it is mostly a negative trend doing so. They are merely a different version of the same product with a change of flavour or ingredients. Some of the car manufacturers and electronic device manufacturers sometimes indeed do extensive research revamping their products and genuinely add new features for their customers. However, most of the time, consumer products or perhaps some of the well-known electronic brands enjoy adding more creativity to their advertisements rather than the real products and hence making the wrong impression on people that they need these new products. 

To conclude, it is through research and development that novelty and innovation of products should be produced and not through tricks of marketing and advertising."
Advertisements are becoming more and more common in everyday life. Is it a positive or negative development?,"Advertising is growing, and nowadays we see advertisements everywhere, for example, on TV, online, on billboards and in printed media. While there are several advantages to advertising, I opine that, overall, the drawbacks are more significant.

 

Admittedly, advertising has several benefits. Firstly, advertising is a key part of modern business. A new and high-quality product is produced  and put on the market but customers do not know about it. Advertising could introduce that product with some eye-catching images and make it become popular in the market. For example, a new soft drink may struggle to compete with established brands on the market. Therefore, it is necessary to promote it through an advertising campaign targeted at the intended audience. Secondly, without advertising, we would have less choice because consumers may not be aware of less-known brands. If the market has only one or two product types, a monopoly may emerge, and that means increased prices due to reduced competition and inefficiency.  When there is competition between many products, consumers have  better choice and can benefit from reduced prices. 

 

Despite the positive aspects mentioned above, I believe that the drawbacks of advertising outweigh its potential benefits. To begin with, children can easily be influenced by advertisements. When children watch unrealistic, exaggerated, or provocative advertisements, they could mimic unsafe actions in them, resulting in dangers to their health and well-being. For instance, an old rule of advertising, and media in general, is that sex sells. Many companies use this idea to market their products, leaving a seriously negative effect on how children think. Children of all ages learn to objectify women as a result of the sexually-charged advertisements that are often seen today whether it is on television screens or magazines. In addition, some adverts manipulate people. They aim to persuade people that a product has a certain function or quality, but that function or quality is non-existent in fact. That is misleading, and it is a major problem with advertising. It means consumers buy the wrong products or products that they do not really need.

 

 In summary, advertising means better choice and lower prices for consumers, but it also has several disadvantages including the negative influence on children and the pressure on consumers to buy the wrong products or products that they do not need."
Whether or not someone achieves their aims is mostly by a question of luck. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"One school of thought holds that most of one’s success is attributable to a stroke of luck. While I accept that this perception is somewhat justifiable, I disagree that people can be successful without hard work and consistency.

It would be imprudent to downplay the role of luck in achieving one’s goals. Although not concretely helping individuals achieve their aims, luck has a colossal impact on their possibility of becoming a successful person. For example, if Kobe Bryant had been born in the same period of time with Michael Jordan, it would have been much more difficult for him to become the best player of the NBA of his time because he would have had to compete with a person who may be better than him at their best, making it more challenging for him to gain as much as success as he did. This is a powerful testament to the influence of fortune on one’s accomplishment.

However, I am of the opinion that prosperity only can be earned by those who are determined and industrious due to a host of compelling reasons. One rationale is that success requires a plethora of high-valued skills, which can only be attained through a process of hard working. For instance, IELTS learners can develop their English skills only by constantly using it on a daily basis. Another justification is that the right mindset also plays an integral part in the path of earning prosperity. This is because it would help one to be able to elucidate their priorities and the right things to do in order to achieve their goals, thereby saving them time of chasing useless objectives

In conclusion, while acknowledging the considerable impact of fortune, I would contend that success only comes to those who are hardworking and patient."
Some people think government should focus on reducing environmental pollution and housing problems to help prevent illness and diseas. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"The line graph above illustrates the average number of passengers which use London Underground Station in a day.

Overall, the chart indicates that the station is open from 6 am in the morning to 10 pm in the night. There are two peak times that show a considerable number of passengers, whereas some intervals show a few people.

The most busy time is at 7 am in the morning. There are around 400 passengers which enter the station at this time. Moreover, another peak time is in the evening. Around 380 people visit the station at 6 pm.

On the other hand, 4 pm is a time which displays the lowest number of passengers. Under 100 people use the station at this time. In addition, in the early morning (6 am), around 100 people use the station which only slighly different compared to the lowest point."
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.

What are the reasons for this?

How can people research this?","In many parts of the world, owners of houses and buildings are becoming more intrigued to unveil the history of the place they call home. This means that they are currently motivated to figure out what the sites have been through in the past. This essay will uncover the underlying reason behind this action and discuss further how to do it. In my opinion, the possible unforeseen consequences of living in certain spots most likely are what piqued people's curiosity.

To most individuals, knowing the events that have occurred inside their homes is a definite way for them to settle there comfortably. For example, the majority of realtors, whose occupation is to sell houses, perhaps heard the question ""What is the story behind this building I should be aware of?"" multiple times in their lives. Therefore, this proves that individuals are taking into account historical facts in order to solely protect themselves from any setbacks that may come with their purchase.

Despite being able to speak and ask the seller in advance, one may still want to research the back story by themselves, which can be done in various ways, such as asking the existing neighbours. Interviewing or calling those who live nearby can help a person to dig a lot of information about the past condition of their building. It is a recommended way since not all realtors or previous homeowners are utterly honest and open due to the fact that they are trying to make a profit. Moreover, reaching out to others allows one to have their questions answered in a friendly way.

In conclusion, current homeowners' investigation is merely done to set their guards up just in case there are unwanted things in the building that can affect them in future. Furthermore, they can do this by making a phone call or arranging a meeting with people from the neighbourhood. Personally, I would highly recommend doing the same thing since it is better to be too cautious than to face unexpected troubles."

What are the reasons for this? 

How can people research this?","In recent years, an increasing number of individuals in various nations have developed a keen interest in uncovering the historical narratives embedded within their homes or buildings. This trend can be attributed to several factors, and individuals can explore their dwelling's history through various means. 

One compelling reason for the surge in interest regarding the history of residences is a heightened appreciation for cultural and architectural heritage. In many societies, there is a growing acknowledgment of the significance of preserving historical structures, as they often serve as tangible links to the past. Residents, therefore, feel a sense of responsibility to understand and safeguard the historical value encapsulated within their homes.

Moreover, the ubiquity of information in the digital age plays a pivotal role in fostering this interest. The accessibility of online databases, archives, and historical records empowers individuals to embark on a journey of self-discovery about their dwellings. Online platforms, such as government archives, historical societies, and public libraries, provide a wealth of information that enables residents to trace the origin, architectural evolution, and past occupants of their homes.

Additionally, the desire for a deeper connection to one's community and roots contributes to the growing interest in house or building history. Understanding the historical context of one's residence fosters a sense of belonging and identity within a community, creating a shared history that binds residents together.

To conduct research on the history of their dwellings, individuals can utilize a variety of resources. Local archives, historical societies, and municipal records often contain valuable information about property ownership, construction dates, and architectural modifications. Furthermore, engaging with older members of the community, such as longtime residents or local historians, can provide invaluable oral histories and anecdotes.

In conclusion, the increasing curiosity about the history of residences can be attributed to a heightened awareness of cultural heritage, easy access to information, and a desire for community connection. By utilizing resources such as online archives, local records, and community members, individuals can embark on a rewarding journey to uncover the rich historical tapestry woven into the fabric of their homes. This not only enhances their understanding of their dwellings but also contributes to the preservation of cultural heritage for future generations."

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","It is unsurprising that people in recent times show more preference in exploring the past history of their properties. The contributing factors might involve self-exploration, interest in culture, and the preservation of historical houses.

Firstly, human beings have a nature for the unknown, regardless of the past or the future, and history provides information about where they are from and who they are, which helps them explore themselves. Moreover, the past customs, traditions, and cultures still have a great impact on people's lives now, which attracts people's attention to the evolving changes of the building or the land. By analyzing the mysteries or stories behind the houses, it also unintentionally raises public awareness of maintaining and preserving the historical buildings and cultures.

It is suggested to start such an adventure by obtaining information and knowledge from the city library. Obviously, most records and profiles ranging from the country to the town are kept in this information center. Meanwhile, these people who are fond of the history of their own house could gather together, post, and share their discoveries on the same platform, which means they can save their work and some repetitive work could be avoided. Regarding the history of the house, I have to say that historians and architects play an important role in promoting new discoveries. So, asking advice from specific experts would be a good choice. Furthermore, some game companies could devote their efforts to this event, which can make it more interesting and educational for younger generations.

How can people research this?","Nowadays, there is an increasing number of homeowners and department renters who have an interest in the history of their accommodations. This is apparent in many cities around the world. The following essay will explain the reasons for this behaviour and how people can search for information about their homes.

The reason why this is becoming a trend is because most people are living in houses or apartments that were built years ago by other people, especially the ones with older architectural styles. People might simply have  curiosity about those who had lived there before them, or things that had happened in the houses they just purchased. Pop culture also has an influence on this phenomenon, since there are many movies, mainly  horror ones, that usually portray a story about a family moving into a new house with hidden treasures or scary pasts.

Individuals can find information about their houses quite easily these days, since many towns own registrations about houses that have been built in the areas. Some data can also be accessible in town libraries and museums. Moreover, people can find out more about the stories of areas where they live from the internet since many towns have online groups for people to send queries and share opinions on local issues.

In conclusion, more people are eager to learn more about the places where they live because they want to know about what it was like in the past. In addition, information about houses can be easily accessible to the public from the town registrations and online resources."

Wholistically people prefer to be cautious and probably predict anything historically. The ways to understand would be followed both indirectly by searching and asking. 

In the beginning, there are some reasons why some communities have found themselves obsessing about the history of their own areas. First and foremost, rationally it would be a sort of conversation if they realize how confident the infrastructure of houses is. Accordingly, who and when the position has been built sounds helpful. To illustrate my point, the earthquake is one of the most convincing reasons. Second, for some, how are religious, it would be fundamentally associated with their pillar of beliefs. For instance, in Islam keeping pets is forbidden owing to their hair, hence, some prejudices care. Third, also the destiny of the previous residences in the case of finding the atmosphere of the place seems significant, such as how wellness they were.

On the other side, thanks to the miracle of the internet it would be possible as knowing one of the simplest ways. As an example, just by the second name, it would be accessible on several web pages while the achievement may be incomplete and holistic. Meanwhile, other paths with much more comprehensive hidden data exist. Real states would be one of them. In fact, even if they had no certain contact, they must be more likely to already know about whatever occurred either for people or building situations. but, as a matter of fact, they might have oriented navigation because they want to sell.  Additionally, asking neighbors is profitable too. indeed, this could be supplemented, besides others mentioned. 

In conclusion, for both logical and spiritual reasons the history of areas and places must be substantial. Rationally, some repair would be essential, and emotionally doing any ceremony or mystery activity to change the energy. So, in terms of finding the truth, technology and related persons will aid."

First of all, as the immediate precedent, being aware of previous owner could help people to personalize the houses. For instance, how acerated were the places maintenance or even about cleaning that in details. but to a great extent, most resident care about the history of the building mysteriously. Not only for finding positive vibe but also weirdly for gathering superstitious story. The main reason for that in my view is owing to movies or novels in this genre. Moreover, if folk realize one of the ex-owners was famous, they have this opportunity to claim residence. Just imagine how explainable would be this situation if an actor created and designed the houses.

On the other side, by the fortunate to having accessible internet the information is truly achievable

On the one hand, there are a couple of factors  why people  followed to reveal the history of their living places. Firstly, some past information and stories may add extra value to particular constructions. For example, some architectures are mentioned their identification (name or signature) in  hidden places. If relevant architectures are popular, the demand is increased for that property. The other reason is  their own knowledge. Some rich humans like to gather antique property. These are the major reasons  why people like to reveal past of the property.

On the other hand, the paths are how people find the history of the home or building where they live. There are several ways. The main source is local records such as property deeds that can be collected from the Province Council. The next way is from neighbours and owners of the property who lived there before. However, most details are mysteries because there is no proof to certify. Hence, people should not depend on these paths. For example,  research in 2002  found that mysteries are flying speedily rather than true stories. Consequently, searching and finding is best but, it should depend on the evidence  seen in our own eyes.

The first and most important reason for curiosity about the origin of a building, is safety. When one buys a house and plans on moving in with their family, they want to be certain that the material used in the construction of the building is compatible with the latest building codes. For instants, in the past century, asbestos was used in the walls, rainwater pipes, etc. but today it is known that it’s a hazardous substance, and even is considered a carcinogen. Another reason for being interested in the house’s past is its sentimental value. One way to find a particular era fascinating or the appearance of the building might feel nostalgic to them.

Give reasons for your answers and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","There is no doubt that these days the number of sold houses increased. the question is, why are people finding the history of the house they live in important to know about? in this essay I'm going to explain the reasons and the methods to find this info.

in terms of reasons, the family search about the history of the apartment as a necessity to see if the apartment is safe to live in. the main reason given to support this claim is that if the building is old and fragile it will not stand any force over it, it will break. To illustrate, The building over time will be weak and easy to be broken. In other words, if there is any water leakage the wood or bricks will be rotten and will cause infection and disease from the fungi, and that comes in a contrast to what people see as a safe residence.

Moreover, some people are terrified of ghosts and spirits so they want a house empty of any demons or spiritual presence. This is because they think if they live in a hunted household they will cast their fate or be cursed for their entire life.

So parents ensure they meet all safety requirements to have a heavenly life out of riskiness for themselves and their children. And they could find this information about the history on the websites that offer houses for sale but they should not rely on salesmen because they could hide some harmful information just to convince you to buy the building. Furthermore, parents would visit the area and ask the neighbours about the house or the community who used to live in it, and I think this is the most convenient way to have reliable and true knowledge. 

In conclusion, although many people believe it is a critical matter to know everything about their households, in my opinion, I think it is an insignificant thing to search for every information about the houses. Therefore, I believe that the only thing that needs to look for is if the condo structure is strong and could afford a crowd to stand on it and if it has resistance to earthquakes or heavy rain. This is the main criterion to have in every domicile."

Firstly, the individuals hope that they can find something very strange about their building, because they want to talk with friends about something new and interesting about themselves and their life.

Maybe they can discover that the ancient owner of the property was a rich man, an artist, or even more a famous writer. For instance, in England, last year a man discovered that one of his ancestors left a chest full of gold doubloons behind the wall of the living room, and after some surveys he found it and he became very rich.

Secondly, they want to know something more about the place, such as the conditions of the building or any problems, so, by knowing the history of their home, is possible for them to study some critical things that can happen in the future and prevent them.

I think they research this for many reasons, perhaps out of interest, or to find a sense of community. For help with finding answers, they should turn to the seniors in their neighbourhoods.

Some people delve into the stories of their homes simply because they are curious. Many historical buildings have been torn down, which makes those that remain uncommon treasures in the city.

There are also crowds who do research to find a sense of connection. With concrete residential buildings everywhere, neighbourhoods nowadays look very alike and therefore it is hard for the public to feel something special about where they live. However, by learning about the buildings that once stood there and the people who lived in them, for example, a sense of connection and involvement may be fostered.

The best way for the crowd to explore, I believe, is to ask the elderly in their neighbourhood. Many seniors have lived in the same neighbourhood all their lives. They have seen it change around them. They have witnessed people coming and going. Talking to them can definitely help one uncover some intriguing stories about the place where one lives.

In conclusion, curiosity and a desire to seek a connection are two possible reasons why people investigate the history of their homes. To find answers, they should ask the old people in their neighbourhood for help."

Firstly, nowadays most old buildings are being demolished to give way to neighbourhoods formed by same-looking concrete cubes. The ones who live in a house instead of a flat feel special and, of course, are intrigued by those who walked the same corridors as them or slept under the same ceiling years ago. Furthermore, they feel that this local culture should be preserved, as well as they hope they will be remembered as well by those who will live there in the future.

For instance, councils keep records of addresses and taxpayers that can be very useful in knowing who was there during the last decades. Additionally, architectural societies have photographic testimonials about how the city developed through the ages.

First of all, the enviroment we live on earth including all livings, species in animals and plants are suffering to pollution. Human made a vast amount of watse gas and water for our living such as driving a car, making a cloths and constructing a home. All these activities produce much of the pollutants such as carbon dioxide, toxic gas and waste water with heavy metals. If living animals absorbs these toxic materals, it can be passed to the next dominent in the live cycle. Finally, we all have to intake porsioned food. That would not be reversed. 

On the other hand, many peolple were willing to take a precationary measure to stop the pollutant emit from our human activities. As in the international carbon reduction agreement signed by many counties such as England, USA and Canada. They want to reduce the carbon emission in order to mitogate the speed of green house effect. That can be greatly descend the trend which lead to sea water level uprising. Many species on earth will be affected by advesity. 

Finally, I think we shall stand out to protect our earth, whatever the animals and plants. It is becasue we all have to relay on animals to get the food. Our furture would be in our hand."
Human activities have a negative effect on plant and animal species. Some people say that it is too late to do anything. Some people think that we should take effective action improve situation. Discuss both sides and give your opinion. ?,"There are tremendously controversial perspectives heating up a debate over what human’s next move is after bringing immense influence on flora and fauna species. While some people hold a strong claim that nothing we can do in this day and age because it is too late, the opposite makes a statement that with a view to revamping the situation, some efficient activities should be implemented.

Without a shadow of a doubt, there is an eclectic mix of convincing reasons which contributes to a notion that it is too late to treat those pressing consequences rooted by humans on plants and animals. They account for those irresponsible and selfish actions ranging from urban sprawl to overgrazing, especially deforestation. For the time being, there is an ever-growing demand for lands to live as well as woods to consume, which breeds abundant species on the verge of extinction and some may have died out already. Pandas in China which are on the brink of extinction nowadays can be cited as a suitable instance. Pupils had set fire to the forests, chopped down a majority of trees on their own purpose, by doing so, those poor pandas consequently lost their home to where they used to settle. Hence, due to a great many persuading roots, it is fairly late for humans to fix what they have done to flora and fauna.

Whilst the negative effects which are bred by humans are widely acknowledged, some effective approaches in order to redress that urgent matter still lingers. There are plentiful reserves that have been put up in order to provide a safe environment for those endangered faunas. Under the government’s observation, Cuc Phuong reserve has been built and become a home for a considerable species ranging from common to rare ones. Thus, proper tactics to cope with these dire issues always exist, however, it depends on how much pupils want to make it come true.

In conclusion, it has never been too late for humans to try to repair their mistakes in the past even with the simplest action, the most pivotal thing is people’s awareness."

Discuss both sides and give your opinion,"There are tremendously controversial perspectives heating a debate over whether floral and fauna species suffer from the negative results of human’s activities. While some hold a strong view that there is no solution to this issue , the opposite makes a statement that positive action should be taken to revamp it. In my opinion, it is never too late to start resolving the problem.

On the one hand, the more humans develop, the more serious impacts on nature will be. People have taken the merits of wild creatures for personal demands. Take deforestation as a representative instance, in order to have more spacious space for working and living, they have been cutting a wealth of trees and plants. That is the reason why the hundred- hecta rainforest disappeared and many species of animals became homeless. Moreover, it not only destroys fauna’s house, but also takes away their food sources. Therefore, human actions lead to the danger and extinction for animals and plants.

On the other hand, I believe that the problem can be enhanced if a bunch of effective measures are taken. Top-north technological means are used to protect flora and fauna. For example, more reserves can be found by  the authorities for endangered animals, like China had been doing for pandas, and utilize genetic technology to help the reproduction of the animals being on the verge of extinction. Hence, every effect is fully useful for the enviroment’s protection.

In conclusion, although people have seriously damaged nature and the species of animals and plants living around, there are still plenty of ways to prevent the harm and improve the positive things which have been done."
Human activities have negative effects on plants and animal species. Some people think that it is too late to do anything about this problem. Other people believe that effective measures can be taken to improve this situation. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"it has been a debatable question whether we should take some actions to address the thorny problems on the decreasing diversity of plants and animals, which are caused by human behaviours. In my view, although people’s activities have a diverse impact on abundant species, there are still some practical measures to maintain and improve plants and animals species.

Some people assert that it is too late to tackle this issue. In other words, it is impossible that plants and animals can recover even with the assistance of modern advanced technologies. For instance, a great number of wildlife’s were killed by hunters in some parts of the world especially in Africa within recent 200 years, which enables people to make money from animal’s skins and bones. Meanwhile, numerous wild animals have been endangered or died out. More importantly, it is extremely tough for biologists to research and find a method to recover old species without genes.

However, in most cases, the crowd is strong advocate that we are supposed to take actions to improve this situation as soon as possible. Furthermore, nature will renew gradually by itself if there is no interruption by human beings; hence, new species will be created which are more adapted to the brand new environment. For example, nowadays an increasing number of natural reserves are established by a variety of countries in the world. Local governments have enacted laws about the protection of wildlife including both plants and animals. With the great effort by the folks, the situations have been changed when it comes to 21th century.

In a word, there is no doubt that people damaged the diversity of plants and animals due to the lack of awareness in the past; however, people can save the rest of species as much as they want with the effective ways."

Some people think that secondary school children should study international news as one of the school subjects. Other people think that it is a waste of valuable school ti. me. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"To servive in this internationally linked world, many people have the opinion that students should learn about the major events which have been happening in the world by introducing a new subject into the official academic curriculum. However, others insist that young students are already fully occupied with existing subjects such as math, science, and additional languages which I also agree with. 

Some individuals would acknowledge that students should learn the international major events and issues to build up their capabilities to accept which is based on worldwide knowledge. Introducing the new subject as the office procedure to teach students international news can support them in increasing their comprehension of the effects of  other countries' issues. As students might not be able to select the appropriate information from the internet by themselves, it would be greatly helpful for them to be prepared as competent international human resources by having a qualified guide from their teachers. 

Despite this argument, the opposite side of people support that having additional subjects like learning international news would bring more burden on young people as they are already full of other academic works such as science, additional languages, and mathematics. As this is the fact thatstudents have been experiencing excessive academic stress with the current curriculum, adding more study will result in unhealthy psychological conditions for students. On the other hand, it would be challenging for teachers to choose the news which will be just based on teachers' own perspectives regarding politics, religion, and other personal beliefs. Students can be affected by the teacher's opinion prior to developing their own viewpoints. 

In conclusion, although students can be equipped with instant international knowledge by learning worldwide news, it cannot be ignored that students might have greater stress with having extracurricular activities on top of what they are already allocated to study. Furthermore, there would be a risk of installing the teacher's personal viewpoints into the students before they establish their own views to see the issues which I am completely convinced with."
Some people think that children should be taught at school to recycle material and avoid waste. Other believe that should be taught at home. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Many people think that children should be taught in school to recycle unused material, while others say that this training should be given at home. This article will discuss both views before a final statement.

On the one hand, the major benefit of teaching students about reusing material and avoiding junk at school is the expertise of mentors. In other words, teachers are trained professionals who can effectively communicate the principles of recycling and staying away from waste to students. Moreover, schools provide a structured and organized learning environment where children can receive formal education on various subjects, including recycling.  For example, in international-level schools like DPS, teachers use a variety of graphs and pictures to give a demonstration to younger ones so that they can understand every aspect of recycling with the help of visuals and put it into practice in their lives. Thus, providing guidance to students about recycling material and avoiding waste is beneficial.

On the other hand, progenitors play a significant role in shaping their juvenile’s values and habits. Put differently, children are more likely to adopt the behaviour of recycling and avoid using waste and carry it into adulthood when parents actively practice and teach recycling at residence . In addition, learning about recycling at home can be more flexible and adapted to individual family routines and lifestyles. Parents can give the lessons to suit the child's age and level of understanding. For instance, mentors can aware their kids about worthless goods such as plastic items, and cardboard items, which are also found  at residences, and have ceased to be used. Hence, progenitors can offer a real-world demonstration of the principles of recycling.

In conclusion, having engaged in the subject, in my opinion, schools should include recycling education in their curriculum; nevertheless, parents must actively participate in teaching and practising recycling at home to their adolescents."
"Some people claim that many things that children are taught at school have wasted their time. Other people argue that everything children study at school is useful at some time.

Discuss both view and give your own opinion.","Children go to school every day and spend much of their time at school. There is an argument that says that a lot of stuff that has been taught for children is such a waste of time! However, others believe that studying at these institutions is helpful and meaningful at some point. In my point of view, I agree that these places are really useful. In the following paragraphs, I will discuss both sides and support my opinion.

To begin with, the reasons behind believing that institutions like kindergarten, primary and elementary faculty are useless because the way that the educational environment limits and kills the children creativity and intelligence. For instance, there is an international kindergarten in my city, and my friend has a son who studied at it she thought they  used a terrible method of teaching young children, which is studying from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. and just 15 minutes for playing, and there is a mid-term and flint test. She believes that her son was excited and smart before. That’s why she thinks  kindergarten was a bad idea and her child was suffering. 

In contrast, people argue that the educational society ,for example, nurseries, kindergartens, primary and elementary schools have many advantages. First, it sharpens the child’s mind and improves the skills of thinking. Like they are studying math, so they can count. Second, it helps to build a relationship with peers and become social hence, he will be friendly, kind, respectful and cooperative. Moreover, solving the problems, she/he will depend on her/home self such as tie his shoes, wear his coat and go to the bathroom. A recent study shows that  COVID-19 time records a significant increase in the number of children who become less creative and social  because they spent two years studying at home. They lost their ability to communicate with their mates and become more violent. Finally, teachers play  role models in children’s lives. When you ask a child who is his teacher in nursery school? Most of them will answer the question and confirm that these instructors were a reason for being successful. My orphan uncle, who lost his parents early, and felt lonely, his hair was messy and wore a dirty uniform. But his teacher was kind and merciful. She was his second mother and encouraged him. Now my uncle is one of the greatest doctors because of her.

To conclude, while some people think that schools have a negative impact on young individuals. I strongly believe that educational communities play a vital role in a child’ life."
Some people think that secondary school children should study international news as one of the school subjects. Other people think that it is a waste of valuable school time. What do you think? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"It is supposed by some people that international news should become a field of study at school, whereas, others oppose the same, and consider that studying it will potentially be a wastage of time. However, I am an advocate of the opinion that in this contemporary epoch of globalization such vital subjects should be read by pupils in order to keep themselves at par with the outside world. 

Firstly, studying international news at an early age enables them to understand the culture of various nations. For example, at my office, most of my colleagues are based at UK. We only have virtual interactions with each other, nevertheless, I still could connect with them well,mainly due to the fact that I am aware about well-known places at London and their cuisines. Hence, this provides me with an upper-hand at work, and I could deliver my work seamlessly.  Therefore, my own viewpoint is that communications become easier if we know each other well and one of the ways to achieve that is through reading global journals. 

Secondly, vital information pertaining to the field of study can be obtained by reading international news. For instance, my sister went to USA in order to pursue her master degree in the field of medicine. Moreover, the university that she attended is one of the eminent institutions. Besides that, she read about the same in an editorial during her school days. Thus, she got motivated  and had worked hard in her career to be a part of this prestigious college. Henceforth, I support the view of studying worldwide news, as it encourages the young boys and girls to work hard as well as climb up the ladder of success. 

To conclude, there are contradictory views about studying international news, some consider that it should be a part of syllabus, while, others are against it.  Nonetheless, I strongly agree that it should be a part of the academic curriculum of children because  it facilitates people to learn about other nations as well as guides them during their higher studies."
"Some people believe that holidays are necessary for students, others think that children should not have holidays because it is just a waste of time. Do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, it  is a moot issue whether children should have holidays or not. It is  believed by a lot of individuals that it shouldn't be, others think that it's just a waste of time,however.From my perspective, it is necessary that children have some free time from their work so, they could relax or learn something new that they haven't yet.

Learning something new that is not related to  academics is the thing that is quite beneficial for them. Since If they would have some time from their main studies that they are having, then they learn something different activities and learn some skills: public speaking cooking time management and so on, which would be beneficial in that they later live especially for take any job and to interact with others.

Have time for recreational activities is another merit of having vacations. It is generally seen that by learning their academics  for a whole year continuously, they get rid of it. So they want some time for them. For instance, many pieces of research proved that if children devote some of their time to activities that help them to be relaxed then it would be better for them as they could perform much better in the exams. 

To conclude, as vacation has a lot of advantages such as they come up with an opportunity to have knowledge about different things that they want to do and relaxation, that are the major ones and because of them, I think that Vacations  should be promoted instead of restriction."
Some people think that children should be taught at school to recycle material and avoid waste. Other believe that should be taught at home. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Many people think that child should be taught in school to recycle unused material, while others say that this training should be given at home. This article will discuss both views before a final statement.

First, the people who hold the notion that universities are responsible for educating students to make most of their time can claim that it is the professors who are capable of imparting this knowledge. There is no doubt that the teachers who, at the proper level, can tell the students and the adolescent about the advantages of reprocessing material and the disadvantages of not using waste, which even pollutes the environment. For example, in international level schools like DPS, teachers use a variety of graphs and pictures to give a demonstration to younger ones so that they can understand each and every aspect of recycling with the help of visuals and put it into practice in their life.

Despite the fact that some schools are putting efforts to enhance the knowledge of adolescents in reusing non-usable items, Parents encourage their teenagers also. It is generally observed and true that worthless goods such as plastic items, cardboard items, are also found most at home, which has ceased to be used. Therefore, parents ought to help their adolescent in understanding , how to recycle this material by illustrations. As a result, juvenile's awareness of the subject will increase, and they will be more aware of reusing such junk at an early age.

To sum up, I understand that although a number of people argue that the whole responsibility for a child's mental development regarding recycling lies with the school, I think schools and families may work together for a better future for their children."
Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time. Discuss both views and give your opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Painting or music is a compulsory subject in most of the schools nowadays. While some think that there are much more important subjects, others believe that art is a very crucial field to learn. Though there are arguments, I radically agree that artcraft must be taught in school study. This essay will discuss both views.

To begin with, subjects like science or technology may sometimes outweigh the significance of drawing or craftwork for various reasons. Firstly, in the practical world, people are only looking for an education which could provide them with a better or secured job. For example, studying mathematics may ensure a better future than painting. Secondly, nowadays kids are very much pressurized by so many different tasks or extracurricular activities, thus parents may want to teach only what could be fruitful in the near future for the children. For instance, a kid takes lessons on mathematics, science, karate and swimming, as a result, any less important area may make an extra burden on the tiny shoulder. This sometimes may be an extra load for the children. Therefore, some think it is a complete waste of time.

On the contrary, music or sculpture may help to grow a child's fundamental knowledge or heal mental stress. There are ample of important subjects a child could learn, however art is definitely one of them. It helps to express inner feelings, explore new things and nourishes minds. For example, an artistic mind is always innovative, hence a kid could experience many things by this. Also, if the student is interested in this, he could choose it as a profession. In other words, Leonardo Da Vinci was a great artist and there is no doubt about his extremely successful career. Moreover, there are so many positive aspects of learning art in school that it could never be a spared.

In conclusion, this essay has discussed both views. Although both views have merits and demerits, I reckon that it is very much needed to include artwork as a compulsory subject in primary education in order to build the students' basic understanding in this matter."
"Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time.
Discuss both views and give your opinion.","It is true, that art is depicted as one of the most crucial directions in the Humanities section. However, some sceptics insist on how meaningless this subject might be for children. Personally, I would support the idea of merging the disciplines into an upscale program for talented individuals. In the other words, my opinion is based on finding the balance between these groups.

On the one hand, not every child is keen on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) subjects. For example, according to the worldwide statistics, 60% of primary school students, mostly enjoy moulding the clay figures and draw, as long as it brings the flow of relaxation. It is widely known, that working with scientific papers and other practical materials requires a high level of stress and anxiety, while the art-related subjects help the pupils expressing their emotions and feelings to the fullest. Moreover, the whole process is operated by the sense of creativity, which is a must-have job qualification nowadays. 

On the other hand, the parental concerns are welcomed to be acceptable, too. Although, the idea of releasing innovative potential may sound promising, the most desirable specialists in 2020 are the software and civil engineers. Having said that, the vast majority of adults are worried about the future perspectives of their children. Unluckily, hard work of, for instance,  graphic designers and book illustrators, is not being paid off well enough. Furthermore, a lot of artistic professions are not taken seriously and considered as not the best value for money, especially, for those parents, whose children are attending private schools.

In conclusion, both scientific and art directions should be highlighted as significant in 2020. I strongly believe, that despite their advantages and disadvantages, they can easily complement each other. In this case, the visual representation of objects can be a great inspiration for the future inventions."
"Some people think that children should be taught at school to recycle materials and avoid waste. Other people believe that children should be taught this at home. 
Discuss both opinions and give your own opinion.","Some people believe that teachers should teach their children recycling materials and avoid waste products in school while others claim that parents should be responsible for teaching their children about this at home. I believe that both places are an essential benefit to teach children.This essay will discuss both the views and the reason to support my opinion will be discussed in detail.

On the one hand, it is apparent that schools are significant in teaching how to reduce waste products that children will learn from professional teachers. In other words, teachers can explain the benefits of recycling and the disadvantages of waste more efficiently. Moreover, schools have specific subjects, which explain how to damage the waste products properly and what can be done to reduce it. For instance, in the geography subject is used to explain the problem of waste and different methods of recycling is given. So, schools can be vulnerable teaching the importance of recycling and reducing waste products.

On the other hand, it is undeniable that most waste products are produced at home. So, children are spending their valuable time with their parents. Therefore, it would be easier for children to learn how to recycle waste produced at home with their parents. Furthermore, children can share the way to reduce waste products at their home to their friends in schools and apply the way to recycle materials at home.

In conclusion, professional teachers and specific subjects in schools can be beneficial for learning about recycling and waste, while parents can practically demonstrate how to reduce waste. In my point of view, both are equally important for children."
Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time discuss both sides and give your opinion,"Art has been the indispensable part of the human civilization from the stone age. Without art man look like a rainbow without colours. Presently some masses of the society assert that art is a crucial subject for children at school, by contrast other people think that it is worthless of time. Here I am going to shed light on both views in the following passages


Manifold points are these to support the former point. Firstly, art connected with culture and if the pupil learns about art subject then they easily learn about our culture and tradition. Secondly, Art is a type of subject which is fruitful in every stage of world if folks learn about the arts in his childhood age then they easily aware the stages of life. Last but not least it also help students to become a better student and improve quality of life for seniors. It sometime acts as a stress buster as well as encourage children to do creative thinking. Art also boost up self esteem of children and provide a sense of accomplishment.


Moving to another phase that, some people of society claim art is wasting of time for learners the core reason behind that students are already burdened with their academic subjects, thus thus adding art subject enhance study load in additional, nowadays there is no job prospects for students in art consequently the opt for other vocational subjects For instance a research conducted in London they found that approximately 70% of people choose science and math subject become of more job opportunities.
 
To sum, no doubt in my Frank opinion that art has  both merits and demerits for children consequently, art subject should be an option subjects at schools"
"Some people think that secondary school children should study international news as one of the school subjects. Other people think that it is a waste of valuable school time. 
Discuss both views.","When considering what to be taught in secondary school, people are still divided about whether the international news should be one of the official subjects or not. While there are benefits to adding this new channel into the classroom, there are also good reasons why it might be helpful to only focus on current curricula. 
The statement that international news should be studied at secondary school is strong for several reasons. In terms of social view, it would help students to gain a wider perspective of the world. In this way, youngsters can be widely acknowledge with current affairs so that they could be aware of how to behave properly. Moreover, in the education view, international news accompanied by different academic subjects such as science, literature, mathematics would complete an integrated learning, which provide students with a full development to lead their life in the future. It is, therefore, clear that global updating plays a vital role in assisting education
On the other hand, it is also understandable that including international news as a subject in secondary school curricula is definitely irrelevant. First, students are now snown with hectic schedule, which may result in overloading if any addings. Moreover, in current education system, especially examniation, it places a great emphasis on academic subjects, if students don’t concentrate enough on these qualifications, they might fail. Secondly, the violence repesented in many of today's news could affect students' performance. This is because at the secondary school’ age, students are still inexperienced to understand those negative aspects. So youngster tends to misjude the situations and act inappropriately. Therefore, the study of international news would be a destructive and wasteful use of school resource.
In conclusion, there are convincing arguments for the study of global news into the secondary school, but it is also reasonable that it shouldn’t add to be an official subject."
Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"There is always a heated debate as to which subjects should be included in the student’s curriculum at the school level. There is a group of people, which is of the view that art should be the necessary subject, whereas, another group asserts that students should not waste time in leaning this subject. I shall discuss both perspectives in detail in the following paragraph before reaching a final verdict.
To begin with, art should not be the compulsory part of school level learning as these sort of subjects do not have a bright career scope. Simply by learning drawing techniques or design creation, students would not get any appropriate white collar job. For instance, if we compare; an artist monthly earning scale is far less than a chartered accountant or a computer engineer.
On the contrary, teaching art is considered to be of paramount importance as it enhances student’s creativity aspects. These subjects urge students to think out of the box, by creating different designs with mixture of colors help students to think beyond conventional theory learning boundaries. By early adaption of creative approach towards problem people become innovative. For example founder of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg is one evident example of creative thinker. He has founded giant facebook organization out of a small social website creation idea.
To recapitulate the aforementioned argument, I opine that subjects like art that polishes student’s analytical thinking should be made part of curriculum. In this fact paced world, we need more creative and proactive thinkers who have the capacity to think beyond borderlines. In future, more and more focus would be on creative learning instead of conventional academic subjects."
"Some people think increasing the cost of fual is the best way to solve global environmental problems.

To what extent do you agree or disagree","Over the last few years,the number of people who prefer to fuel has increased significantly.Although there are several advantages of fuel,it can have some disadvantages as and drow a conclusion.

On the one hand,there are several benefits of fuel increase.The first merit of it is considered to be that is the income from fuel.For enstance, nowadays,peolpe's demands for fuel are increasing, because the number of people in our country is increasing year by year, so the prices of fual are increasing.Another positive aspect is though to be that solving these global promlems,This is because if we do not solve this proplem,it will eventually lead to many things.

One the other hand,despite mentioned positives it also has its downsides.One of the major disadvantages of it is that harms the environment.For example,it emits foul odors and poisons person.Another important demerit is that expected price.This is because many people may not always be able to afford it.

In conclusion,while fuel can offer several positives there may be some drow back too.From my personal point of view,agree of this will out weigh the disagree"
"Some experts suggest people a method to solve the environmental problem is to increase the cost of fuels and all vehicles.  

To what extent do you agree with this point? and make comparisons where relevant.",Environmental pollution has been a viral topic in contemporary society. One of the biggest contributors to air pollution goes to carbon dioxide emission. It is disagreed that the solution to solve this problem is to charge more for fuels and all vehicles. Finding substitutions for oil which is more environmentally friendly and issuing policies to impose high penalties on using extra cars  would be more effective measures.
Some people think the government should increase the cost of fuel for cars and others vehicles to solve environmental problems. Give your opinion.,"The pollution caused by vehicles on roads is a major contributor to environmental problems.The number of vehicles is increasing constantly and so is pollution. Some people are of the view that increasing the fuel prices by the government will help curb this problem, but this is not the case. I think, increasing the fuel prices would motivate people to use public transport to help save the environment, but a very limited population will opt for it and there would not be a major reduction in environmental problems with this approach.

To begin with, most of the people choose comfort over cost. Even if the cost of fuel rises, due to the comfort and convenience one gets by travelling in their own vehicle, a majority will still continue to use their cars and personal vehicles. Increasing fuel prices will not have much impact on personal vehicle usage. In addition, travelling in a personal car saves time and everyone prefers to be punctual and become more effective. Hence, they will not let go of their personal vehicles even though the fuel price rises.

Secondly, the population is increasing day by day and public transport facilities are not expanding at the same rate. For instance, there is a lot of crowd on inter-city buses on weekdays as a lot of people travel to other cities for work. They have to wait to get transport such as a bus or an auto. Hence, to solve these issues, they opt to travel in their own car. Hence, the government has to expand the local transport system in order to curb pollution by personal vehicles and cars.

In conclusion, I think there are other aspects that the government has to work on in order to control environmental pollution. They can take the help of technology to bring in green fuel to be used in vehicles rather than restricting its use. Restricting the use of cars by raising fuel prices will not help much in saving the Mother Earth"
some people think that the best way to solve global environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The global environmental problems are coming in the first  earth problem`s list, therefore all offers should  come hand in hand to end these troubles and have a clean planet.

First, of ,course one of the ways to reduce  global environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel, which makes people think twice before using their car or turning on the heating, They will use it at the needed time, not every time. For instance, I remember when I was in Syria and petrol was very expensive, we had not used it a lot, and we heated one room instead of three.

Second, there were a lot of methods to make people reduce using  fuel, like decreasing the price of electronic cars, encouraging them to ride the popular buses or trains and making workshops to be aware of the environment and their problems. For example, I have my own car, and I look forward to having an electronic car but it is so expensive compared to mine or normal cars.

As a result, in my ,opinion the world must be a part of saving the environment, and do anything logical to solve the global environment, without being so hard on people, We just need to aware and hand in hand with our environment."

You should write at least 250 words.","With the rising number of environmental issues , many suggest that increasing the prices of vehicles and car fuels will help save the escalating situation , I totally agree that this solution will contribute positively as it will force people to replace their fuel-working vehicles with electric ones or rely on public transportation and also it's known that around the world nations that provide cheap fuel prices suffer with environmental hardships the most.

To begin with , a surge in the prices of fuel can lead to pleasant outcomes , if it were to occur in a particular nation people will start to think about alternatives that could be more environmentally safe , for instance , the government of Norway , is known for its harsh taxation policies against fuel products , therefore , the number of electric cars sold in the country is one of the most worldwide .

In addition , countries that have low gas prices are said to be the most polluted , moreover , people in these states heavily depend on fuel-based cars , for example , Saudi Arabia has one of the cheapest gasoline prices in the world , given that fact , almost everyone ones a car ran by it , furthermore , it's one of the most polluted places according to the Air Quality Index , however ,in recent years the Saudi government has been funding public transportation and making it cheap and accessible for everyone , and this based on other countries experiences , will surely be a positive development for the surroundings .

To sum up , increasing the prices of fuel products is an effective way to reduce pollution, as it will make individuals seek  other means of transport , on the contrary , it's evident that doing the opposite and declining the prices can be very harmful and have a lot of serious consequences."
Some people believe that one of the best ways to solve environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Green issues have become increasingly popular among some demographics of our society. Some people strongly believe that one of the most efficient ways of resolving such problems would be a significant rise in fuel prices. This essay will discuss that such change could only be a partial resolution. The reasons supporting this opinion will be discussed below. 

To start with, a lot of people consider that if we put up the price of petrol and gas for automobiles, we would end up with a much lower number of vehicles on the streets. This in its turn would lead to cutting the number of exhaust fumes, which admittedly are one of the main reasons for causing environmental dilemmas. Furthermore, in case of high gasoline prices, people not only drive less but will generally travel smart, try to stay closer to home for shopping, combining various errands to be more efficient. And this potentially would reduce an average carbon footprint and contribute to conserving nature. Thua these few instances have bolstered an opinion that upsurge of an upsurge in fuel costs would help to tackle the green issues. 

However, regardless of the benefits above, the idea that environmental challenges could be eradicated only if fuel prices are higher is not completely valid. The rationale behind it is that ecological concerns are caused not only by poisonous car emissions but also by a high number of other factors such as population expansion, pollution of land and water through excessive deforestation, industrialisation and overfilling landfills which emit CO2 and add to greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, reducing emissions through increasing prices and discouraging people from driving less, will only be an interim solution to the problem. Furthermore, an upsurge in fuel prices will affect transportation-focused industries like airlines and trucking, not only automobiles. Anything that must be shipped or transported—from apples to electronics—could cost more as gas prices rise. This is especially true for products, or components for products, that are manufactured overseas. Overall, the idea that increased prices on fuel would resolve the green issues could potentially lead to a far worse outcome for society. 

To conclude, this essay argued that increasing prices on fuel could be only a partial solution to environmental concerns and people who believe the opposite underestimate the real effects of what they believe. In my opinion, solving key issues is vital, however, we should not solely depend on one resolution and try to see more efficient and diverse ways of maintaining the environment clean."
"Some people think that the best way to solve global environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel.

To what extent do you agree or disagree.","Many of the public think that  incline  material amount will decrease  global environmental issues.I totally agree with this statement because nowadays many emissions are releasing the most dangerous air deterioration it will be decreased when authorities increased by fuel prices. I will explain my opinion in this essay clearly and I will give examples.

on one hand, several working people and industries are using diesel and petrol to run the factories to work the machines. Many citizens are using more cars and motorbikes it will produce more dust contamination and moreover,traffic jam also facing the society however it will escalation the global warming too. To reduce this problem to expand ammunition public will reduce the service of motorbikes and cars instead of they can purpose public transport it will help to decrease atmosphere infection and traffic jam also. For example, many countries are taking this challenge to reduce the deterioration they increased ammunition prices it will be going better improvement many of citizens using public transport  in those countries breeze infection also decreased.

secondly, Many industries benefit some fuels to the increasing emissions fuels in the are they are the main cause of atmosphere abuse to develop the global warming issues. In my ,opinion some factories should take  responsibility for the employees to arrange  transportation like buses it will reduce  air deterioration automatically moreover they can less handle fuels instead of they can use some other sources it will also help to the reduction of the global environment.

in conclusion, in my opinion , The government should be increased the fuel prices and arrange  more public transport it will helpful for people and  reduce global warming also and factories also use less fuel."
people think that government should increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicle to solve environmental problems. give your opinion.,"The use of fuel gradually has the worst impact on environmental issues. Some people believe that increasing the price of fuel for vehicles can decrease the impact on the natural surroundings in the future. Even though there are people who are declined, in this paper, I will partially agree with this solution.

Increasing the price of oil for vehicles can cause harm for society. Especially the impact on the economy. For instance, the cost of commodities and transportation will be as costly as the cost of fuel. The public would have difficulty fulfilling their basic needs and maybe increase the percentage of poverty in the country. However, this phenomenon might be impactful for the middle down society instead of the wealthy community. 

On the other hand, with regards to the price of oil increasing, users of thefuel energy will decrease. Nevertheless, scientists will then invent alternative energy to replace theoil. For instance, biogas energy which is made from organic waste and a fuel made from plants or vegetable materials. Those fuels are environmentally friendly and can be accepted by society. In addition, inventors will be finding energy efficient vehicles in the future. And Tesla is a good example of this, namely Elon Musk designing an electric car charged by energy from electricity or a solar panel.

In conclusion, I believe this decision will be better for the environment as well as human beings and I wholeheartedly support this argument, even though some people will feel the enormous impact in the first phase. Better solutions are invented to replace the use of oil."
People think that the government should increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles to solve environmental problems. Give your opinion.,"It is believed that the best solution to environmental problems would be for government to increase the cost of fuel. This notion is fundamentally justified, yet other measures might have an even greater impact.
 On the one hand, there are two primary reason why raising the petrol prices is the critical way to solve environmental issues. First, motorists would limit the number and length of their journeys by private cars to compensate for the extra expense. Government should then be forced to upgrade and expand public transport, as people still have to work, travel to meet their daily needs, for example. Second, if the price of petrol increase, more freights and goods are more likely to be transported by rail than trucks. This will lower emissions from vehicles, as such reducing the greenhouse effect.
On the other hand, the importance of other measures must not be underestimated. The logic behind this is that the onus falls on government to impose restrictions on the advertising motorized transport and require media outlets to promote the positive image of cycling, one of the most environmentally-friendly vehicles. Once the stigmas around bicycling are removed and the general public are better-informed of its environmental benefits, more bikes are expected to be seen on the road. Furthermore, the local authorities in London, for example, introduced the congestion charge on all vehicles visiting in the city center. They use the money raised to subsidize the cost of fares and to invest in transport infrastructure that will improve the air quality, resulting in the reduction of exhaust fumes.
In conclusion, although raising the price of petrol is a plausible environment-related transport measure, other steps would be more effective in the long term. Government should strike a balance between these approaches in an effort to go green."
"Some people think the best way to solve global environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel.

To what extent do you agree or disagree ?","Some individuals argue that the most efficient way to tackle global environmental crisis is by increasing fuel prices. Though I agree that it will help solve the problem to some extent, I believe that promoting awareness about eco-friendly alternatives are a far better method to adequately address most environmental problems.

On the one hand, by increasing fuel prices, people are forced to resort to public transportation, as not everyone can afford it. This way, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere can be reduced, since the major contributor to air pollution is the carbon emission from individual vehicles. However, in India, even though fuel prices have increased marginally over the years, people still continue to drive their own vehicles and do not prefer using buses and trains. This is because public transport is often unreliable and inefficient. Therefore, increasing fuel prices alone has not resulted in a significant drop in pollution levels.

On the other hand, I believe that a remarkably convenient option to tackle environmental concerns is increasing public awareness about the various methods by which they can contribute to ecological safety. Through presentations, conferences and international summits, people can be educated to adopt environmentally friendly measures. This is highlighted by the “Recycle and Reuse” campaign introduced by the WHO, which promotes the use of paper bags in place of plastic shoppers through educational campaigns conducted all throughout the world. This has resulted in a drastic reduction in the generation of toxic plastic waste universally. Although these measures are taken on an individual scale, their cumulative effect on environmental conservation is undeniable.

In conclusion, I am convinced that raising fuel prices might help combat the environmental problems to some degree, yet educating the public about greener alternatives is far more productive."
Some people think it is one of the best ways to solve environmental problems by increasing the cost of fuels for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Many people believe that the pressing issues of environment can be curbed by raising the price of automobiles and fuel. This essay agrees with this viewpoint as it can lead to less pollution and traffic on the roads. 

Primarily, majority of the people are concerned about the heightened problem of environment, which has become so filthy due to manhandled practices. It is often seen that in every household people are having two or three cars, which not only lead to heavy traffic on roads but also put pressure on our surroundings as these motor vehicles emit poisonous gases. For example, in north America, on an average every young member of a family has a vehicle, which leads to increased level of carbon emission. Therefore, it has been decided by certain section of people to elevate the price of auto mobiles and petrol, to regulate the environmental conditions. 

Furthermore, the government could implement the theory of demand and supply inversely, by curbing the supply of vehicles and fuel, as the level of pollution has increased globally, which is responsible for global warming. Had the supply of these products controlled at an early stage, the demand would have been automatically reduced. This has become an alarming issue now, which needs to be regulated by the authorities. 

However, there are some people who are against this trend and do not want any increase in prices as they feel it would be an unnecessary financial burden on them. For instance, many people are already bearing the numerous monthly expenses and the rising prices will give an additional monetary load. 

To conclude, although, there are people who are against this idea of soaring prices, I agree that the authorities should elevate the prices to cut down the usage and demand, otherwise, the existence on the earth would be next to impossible."
Some people think that the government should increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles in order to solve environmental problems. To what extend to you agree or disagree?,"One of the most conspicuous trends in today's world is combustion vehicles. Some people believe that increase in fuel prices can reduce carbon emission from transportation. On the other hand, others argue that it will increase the release of greenhouse gases and it does no good of the environment. As such, there are both merits and demerits for this trend, this essay will explain that increase in fuel prices cannot reduce ecological problems.


Firstly, crude oil is the main source of fuel available for mass transportation in the current world; however, increasing crude oil prices can even worst the current situation because it is the only reliable gas source. In addition, no matter how expensive the oil cost consumers can afford to purchase until an alternative is provided by the public administrators. For instance, increase in taxation for tobacco goods did not reduce its sales and the same will happen for fuel as well.


Secondly, scientists should focus more on the Eco friendly renewable source of energy transportation to help the environment. Furthermore, the government should impose strict laws and provide more public transportation to reduce carbon footprint. For example, Tesla invented electric cars that can perform with electric power source, which is renewable and zero carbon emission. Hence, step by step we can eliminate the greenhouse gas release for clean and green atmosphere.


In conclusion, one can clearly understand that we have to create green energy with available sources with no harm done in the air and people. Finally, the role of the environment is too dire to ignore."
Many people believe that governments should raise the cost of fuel of cars and other vehicles to solve environmental problems. State your opinion?,"In this argument, the author writes to recommend The Mozart School of Music to all parents wishing their children to participate in music lessons. However, this presumably profit-driven argument is flawed in several ways.
Firstly, the author stated that this music school welcomes all children, regardless of their age, skill levels and their planned area of study, and such a wide range of offerings must be beneficial to every youngster. However, this is quite often not the case, since most children would be more inclined to interact and socialize with people of their own age and with similar abilities. Trying to integrate too many different aspects of music into one facility is difficult at the very least, and such a hodgepodge approach might confuse or alienate children. Small is beautiful, as the saying goes.
Secondly, the author purports that the many distinguished musicians in the faculty will surely increase the ability of this institution to teach music. This is a baseless assumption, since it depends on the fact that these musicians are not only intimately involved in the actual teaching of all pupils, which is unlikely, and also such exceptional expertise will put the children further ahead on the path to success. Most beginners would usually not need to interact with the best in the field to learn and improve their skills- careful mentoring and well-judged encouragements are often much more important.
Last but not least, the author claims the many successful musicians graduating from the school must be a proof of its success. But this more likely points to the fact that this is a sprawling facility with many students, as the first two arguments have shown. Anyway, most people will not reach the expert level no matter how hard they practised, and they know this. Some may just be trying to find a hobby."

"Some people think that one of the best ways to solve environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","These days the number of cars which are bought have been increasing as a consequence, there have become more adverse environmental effects. Thus, some people believe that the increasing of fuel’s price will be an effective solution for these problems. In my stance, this will not solve the environmental problems and will create another issues. This essay discusses these issues.

First, buying a vehicle in present era is considered more essential than before, obviously, about one person in every family has become have a car. The increasing of the cost of fuel will not make people sell their cars. To illustrate, having a vehicle is vital and has many purposes such as, travelling or working. Thus, if the government raised the amount of fuel, it will be such a load on citizens. For example, in Egypt, in 2018, the cost of fuel has been increased twice; however, no one has sold his vehicle for this reason. Moreover, the prices of buying new cars have increased.

Second, every country has public transportation as a main method of moving. The obvious result in increasing the fuel costs will be the rising of public transportation’s fees. Not only will the cost increase on private vehicles but also will be on public transportation. It is highly recommended that the governments will encourage people to buy hybrid cars that they should consume less fuel and emit less carbon dioxide than the comparable conventional petrol or diesel-engine vehicle. Consequently, it will dispose the undesirable impacts on environment.

In conclusion, I totally disagree with increasing the fuel costs in order to decrease the environmental challenges. The predicted results of this solution have many demerits, thus governments should avoid them."
Some people think the best way to solve global environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Environmental degradation is a rising issue in the contemporary world. According to the number of people, the surge in the price of fuel is a way to mitigate this problem. I agree up to some extent, however, there are other major solutions, mainly restricting waste disposable and deforestation.

Admittedly, increasing the cost of the fuel is a basic option to cope with the environmental issue. Price hike of the ammunition such as petrol and diesel means, less private vehicles usage, as people would opt to other options for transportation such as public transport system; hence air will not be polluted, as there would be less smoke released from vehicles. China, for instance, in 2016, had been able to decrease the air pollution up to 13%, by introducing fuel’s price increase. Thus, price increase of ammunition is one of the basic measure of saving the environment.

On the other hand, I think there are other effective strategies to address the nature related problems. Firstly, banning waste disposable from industries and factories is one way of solving the rising water pollution issue. This is because disposable materials produced from different industries drained off in the sea and contaminate the water. Which in turn is devastating for sea animals. Another viable option is to discourage deforestation. Cutting trees lead to the deficiency of Oxygen, which is an immense requirement for the better environment. For example, International organization of climate protection has conducted a study that each year climate is becoming deteriorating by the 25% decrease in the production of Oxygen, owing to the deforestation. Therefore, controlling disposable products and prohibiting cutting trees enormously assist in keeping the environment safe.

In conclusion, to control the degradation of nature is a sparked topic these days. Some people say that increasing the fuel cost is a way. In my view, this will be helpful up to some extent, but there are other efficient measures such as preventing raw disposable materials and cutting trees.

Some people believe that one of the best ways to solve environmental problem is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There is no doubt that these days pollution rate has increased recently. Some people argue that the best option to shrink environmental issues by increase the cost of fossil energy used for transportation . I totally disagree with this statement for an array of reasons . In this essay, I will discuss the reasons and provide a number of suggestions to solve this phenomenon. 

First of all, increasing the price of fuel has a minimal impact on protecting our environment from pollution and climate change and will have a significant rebound negative impact on an individual level and on microenterprises .This will cause financial strain on those less fortunate. While wealthy and large scale business owners will be likely unaffected. For these reasons, there will be an increasing poverty level for those affected and that could possibly lead to other issues like a rise in stealing and crime rates. 

Furthermore, there are more effective ways to protect our environment rather than increasing the expense of fossil fuels . Such as increasing the use of renewable sources and encouraging the use  of recyclable materials.By doing such things, society can benefit more as recyclable is a more practical way of saving money. Furthermore, making use of renewable sources such as solar , wind ,and water energy. This will help reduce the amount of fossil fuel circulating in the atmosphere . 

To sum up , repricing crude is not an optimal way to solve environmental issues. This will hurt the poor and benefit the rich , which could create tension,worse lead to other social issues such as a rise in crime rates, while there are different renewable sources that should be considered that are environmentally friendly such as water energy and etc ."
Some people believe that one of the best ways to solve environmental problem is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is argued that it is possible to resolve a part of environmental problems if the cost of fuel for the personal and commercial transport will significantly increase. I particularly agree with this statement and in this essay, I will try to explain why. 

On the one hand, burnable fuel it is the main resource of energy in modern world, and the cost of the fuel has a great impact for the cost of food and goods, hence people try to save their money what extend to conscious consumption of the fuel and more effective logistic ways. Therefore, the fuel economy is decreased amount of the pollution to the environment which has a positive influence on the nature. Moreover, cost of fuel extends to developing of advanced technology and it is a fact that modern cars have a less exhaust of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than earlier. For example, Scandinavian countries stimulate people to keep the fuel economy policy and to have modern vehicles by way to cancellation of taxes to the owners of cars with zero emissions. 

On the other hand, increasing the cost of the fuel in poor countries, could stimulate people to use mo cheaper and dirtier fuel, which only increases air pollution."
Parents should encourage children to spend less time studying and more time doing physical activities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Over the past few years,the issue of children's free time has been widely debated. However, some parents think children should spend more time on academics because that is very important for their future.In my opinion, outdoor activities are more crucial to them as I will discuss both sides in the following essay.

There is no doubt that studying in lectures is important, because that is one of the basic responsibilities of students. For example, in Taiwan,there is an obligate education policy which means it is compulsory for citizens to abide for 12 years of education from elementary school to high school. Moreover,Some students have to go to cram school after class ,this can put a high pressure on students for their study performance. Furthermore,learning knowledge and skills is vital at a young age,because education can be a factor in future development,and is highly correlated with future success in the eyes of some parents.

On the other hand,some parents think exercise is always the priority for their children,due to teenagers growing up very fast in this time period,it is called a” golden time”. After this period, it becomes challenging to influence the physical growth of children,that is the reason why parents should put more emphasis on their health.This includes nutrition, body flexibility, and mental well-being, especially since children may not cope well with excessive academic pressure.

In conclusion,studying hard in academics and doing outdoor activities are two essential factors and should not be ignored when children are growing up,provided parents can give more balance on both sides, it could be beneficial to their children."
"Some people believe that it is the government’s responsibility to provide care and finance to support people after they retire. Others, however, think that individuals themselves should save money in their own when they are old.

Discuss both views and give your opinion. > DISCUSS AND OPINION","Nowadays, an increasing number of people are concerned about the finance issue after they retire. However, whether they should save money by themselves or receive assistance from the government is a controversial issue. This essay will discuss both sides and my view is that a financial-independent person will bring more merits.

It is clear that authority plays an important role in allocating resources to improve their national security and the general welfare of its people. A disturbing fact is that there are a lot of older citizens who unable to work to earn a living out there, some of them even do not have their own children to rely on. So, the government should give their top priority to assuring high-quality life for especially the elderly. However, a strong rising of the old-age dependency ratio year by year seems to be a great burden on the government efforts of improving the quality of life. If each person can save money on their own, the government could spend these expenses to solve other problems like reducing the unemployment rate or tackle environmental issues and so on.

Besides, it is undeniable that the older generation today have rich knowledge and gain many practical experiences through their career, hence, they have self-awareness enough to prevent themselves from becoming a social burden as they are afraid of being an unworthy person when they get old. Although each family member should take care and provide basic needs for the elder people, it would be unethical for the old to rely totally on them. So they tend to save a certain amount of money from their monthly income in their early period of a career in order to avoid dependency on others and enjoy their old age. 

In conclusion, despite governments should hold the duties of providing its citizens with efficient subsidies, I believe that people should prepare for their living expenses when they get older rather than expect from government grants."
Some people think the main purpose of schools is to turn the children into good citizens and workers rather than to benefit them as individuals. to what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"A multitude of parents is grimly advocating that children are more likely to be educated by schools as  qualified employees and law-abiding citizens to contribute themselves to their countries as opposed to thinking independently and critically about their own life and ambitions. From my perspective, I strongly disagree with this view.

There are several reasons why I would argue against teaching students is aimed to give priority to cultivating a variety of workers and dwellers. Firstly, it is obvious that a multiplicity of students are educated in different abilities and knowledge at school, which provides more opportunities that they cannot acquire by themselves, especially some poverty-stricken students, such as becoming exchange students to study abroad and participating in practical activities to enrich their experience. Secondly, governments are strongly appealing to schools to pay more attention to multicoloured school lives and competitions, in order to explore more potential students in many aspects. finally, I believe that if students could be taught courses as a springboard to know more about the world. Particularly like philosophy, math, art, music, moral class and science.

On the other hand, educational institutions are not only teaching children how to possess more knowledge but make a contribution to their countries and governments with more outstanding employees for future development. However, undeniably, overforce students to become excellent citizens may have an adverse impact on societies. One highly persuasive example is that people under the pressure of overload may ubiquitously generate mental and physical problems. For instance, some college entrance examinations in many countries cause a myriad of students had stayed up all night, which results in death eventually. Therefore, becoming individuals should be prioritized and dealt with immediately by schools.

By way of conclusion, although some over-competitive schools tend to cultivate students' excellent academic performance, authorities and schools teaching prior various types of things to cultivate them as independent individuals first."
"2) Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Teenager is a very active phase of life when they have so much curiosity to explore about the world.  In order to utilize that energy in a positive way, I do believe that they need to be involved in a social work as a volunteered. This will help for a community as well as teenagers themselves as it will give them a kind of sense of being worthwhile in a society. Moreover, it is obvious that community will get benefit from it as it will help to build harmonious society.  

There are three reasons why I recommend to include teenagers in unpaid social work. Firstly, when teenagers start working in the community from the early age of their life, they will learn different life skills which will be useful for them in the future. Furthermore, it will help them to gain work experience which will make their life easy to find the job in their adulthood. Moreover, teenagers will feel the sense of being included and being part of the society which help them to grow mentally and physically. Thus, I strongly support to involve teenager in social activities. 

Secondly, encouraging teenagers in social work will help to lower the risk of them getting involved in illegal activities. As teenagers are very curious by the nature to see the world and they can easily influences by other as their articulative ability to distinguise right and wrong is not fully develop, they might choose the wrong way during this stage of life. Therefore, keeping them busy in community work in their free time will help to distract them from making the bad decision in their life. 

Thirdly, involving teenagers in a community volunteer work will set an example for others to be selfless and help each other. Moreover, it will help to build a peaceful, harmonious and cooperative environment in the community. In addition, observeing teenager doing the social work will encourage others to do the volunteer work in future. Furhtermore, teenagers will feel empower, proud and confident being part of the society and being able to bring the change in the community. 

Thus, it is beneficial for both community and teenagers themselves, I would highly recommend them to participate in social activities."
Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree.,"It is believed that teenagers should be engaged in more and more voluntary work without any monetary benefits in their spare time. This involvement will be beneficiary for them as well as for the people of the community by building up their confidence level and adding value to their career pathway. In my opinion, I completely agree with the statement.

On the one hand, teenagers can be involved in many community works such as environmental issues, peace and conflict issues, and women & gender issues in their leisure time. The diversity of work will help them to upgrade their level of confidence. In the long run, they will benefit from their activities and these activities will work as a factor of advancement in their life. A recent study concluded that around 75% of teenagers are working for their community without any money.

On the other hand, various types of community work will add extra value to the curriculum vitae of teenagers. A recent study shows that about 70% of high school-going students are becoming part of these voluntary works only because of their advancement of career which can be gained from community work. Nevertheless, teenagers can fit themselves in any situation by doing this type of work that will help them in the long run of their lives.

In conclusion, unpaid community work is beneficial not only for boosting the confidence level up but also for the career development of teenagers. They should increase their engagement in community work more."
"Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free times. This can benefit teenagers and benefit the community as well.

To what extend do you agree or disagree.","In the present world, most teenagers used to help each other, even, if they do not have any payment. Some individuals opine argue that children who have not completed 18 years have to do social work without any pay. I completely agree with this statement. And, in this essay, I will discuss how important these jobs are to teenagers.

Firstly, in this society, everyone should help each other because it will be able to need some help for  people. In addition, it is important to do teamwork to young society for learning how to work together."
Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree.,"There exists a considerable debate in society regarding the responsibility for maintaining personal health and fostering a balanced diet, with one faction advocating individual accountability, while others argue for governmental intervention in dietary matters. Personally, I concur with the notion that individuals should be primarily responsible for their well-being. This essay will delve into both perspectives in a comprehensive manner before explicating my position.

On one hand, proponents of the viewpoint that individuals are accountable for their health and dietary choices assert that each person possesses unique insights into their own physical constitution, rendering them the most qualified to determine what dietary regimen suits their needs optimally. Essentially, it is contended that individuals' preferences regarding favorite foods, fruit, and dietary preferences such as vegetarianism remain intimately private and not readily ascertainable by others. Moreover, given the diversity of lifestyles, including those engaged in athletic pursuits, the dietary requirements of individuals vary significantly, necessitating personalized approaches to well-being. Consequently, adherents of this view assert that self-care is the most prudent course of action, as no external entity can rival the intimate understanding an individual has of their own health and dietary proclivities.

On the other hand, an opposing faction posits that governments bear a societal duty to oversee and manage public health and dietary patterns. This perspective is founded upon the notion that citizens contribute substantial tax revenues to support governance, thus mandating an obligation on the part of authorities to ensure the welfare of their constituents. Proponents of this stance advocate for the implementation of specialized programs, including regular blood tests, cancer screenings, and dietary initiatives, designed to promote and sustain a healthy populace. Additionally, they argue that governments can disseminate information and knowledge through informative television programs, thereby empowering individuals to make informed choices and cultivate healthier lifestyles. From this vantage point, it is incumbent upon the government to assume an active role in safeguarding the health and dietary practices of society.

In conclusion, while a case can be made for government involvement in dietary monitoring, I firmly believe that individuals must assume primary responsibility for their well-being and nutritional choices. By virtue of possessing intimate knowledge of their lifestyle and dietary preferences, individuals are better equipped to make informed decisions concerning their health and diet. Thus, fostering a proactive approach to self-care remains pivotal in cultivating a healthier society."
Some people think that all teenagers should be required to do unpaid work in their free time to help the local community. They believe this would benefit both the individual teenager and society as a whole. Do you agree or disagree?,"Many teenagers take part in volunteer work nowadays, whether it be out of kindness or to have something for their resumé. However, the concept of imposing unpaid work on them to benefit the local community raises issues regarding ethics and perhaps even the law. Therefore, I wholeheartedly disagree with it.

It is integral that we consider this issue in a more ethical manner. Teenagers, as they stand, are already making a considerable impact on our society through academics alone. It would simply be outrageous to add onto their responsibilities and require them to balance both work and school, let alone unpaid work. As teenagers, they have the right to experience everything their youth has to offer— spending time with friends, finding hobbies, doing fun activities, and so on. Studying already takes up enough of their time.

But of course, there are legal factors that come into play as well. Teenagers are, by definition, people aged between 13-19 years. Thus, most teenagers would be considered minors. In turn, under the eyes of the law, that may make forcing teenagers to work equivalent to child labor in most cases. 

To conclude, I absolutely disagree with requiring teenagers to do unpaid work to benefit the local community. In fact, I dare say that it is blatant exploitation of teenagers. Motivating young people to do volunteer work and contribute to the local community is always good, but never turn that hard work into an obligation. Good deeds should come from the heart, not requirements."
Some People Think That The Teenagers Should Be Required To Do Unpaid Work In Their Free Time To Help The Local Community. They Believe This Would Benefit Both The Teenagers And Society As A Whole.,"Youngsters are the building blocks of the nation and they play an important role in serving  society because at this age they are full of energy not only mentally but physically also. some people think that youth should do some voluntary work for the society in their free time and it would be beneficial for both of them. I agree with the statement. it has numerous benefits which will be discussed in the upcoming paragraphs.

To begin with, they could do a lot of activities and make their spare time fruitful. first of all, they can teach children living in slum areas because they are unable to afford education in schools or colleges. as a result, they will become civilized individuals and do not indulge in antisocial activities. by doing this they could gain a lot of experience and becomes responsible towards the society. it would be beneficial in their future perspective.

In addition to this, they learn a sense of cooperation and sharing with other persons of the society. for instance, they could grow plants and trees at public places and this would be helpful not only to make the surrounding clean and green but reduce the pollution also to great extent. moreover, they could arrange awareness programmes in society and set an example among the natives of the state. this will make the social bonding strong between the individuals and this will also enhance their social skills.

In conclusion, they can “kill two birds with one stone” because it has a great advantage both for the society and for the adolescents. both the parents, as well as teachers, should encourage the teens to take part in the activities of serving the community in their free time."
some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time .This can benefit teenageers and the community as well .to what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, many NGOs (Non-government organizations) promote community services by inviting people from all walks of life. Some people believe that number of youth participation is discouraging yet, therefore, they should be compelled to take part in such activities during their leisure. In this essay, I will explain why I completely agree with this idea. 

In modern times, most children have sedentary lifestyles in their free time. Given the instant gratification from social media, Netflix-like applications, and other multimedia gadgets, the youth, now, is more incompassionate about society as a whole. While involved in welfare work, they develop empathy and awareness regarding the problems faced by the world. Voluntary services in an environmental organization, for instance, can help a youngster to learn the impacts of global warming, and contemporary precautionary measures can make the world a safer place for the next generations. Similar opportunities can make a person a good human being and a compassionate member of society.

On the other hand, working for a voluntary organization can harness a youngster with life skills. Take fundraising activity as an example. Such an activity for a charity can help learn money matters such as finance management. Apart from real-life learning,  mention of such an experience in a CV would add value, thus, a brighter chance of earning employment. Indeed, welfare and charity works have a knock-on effect on an individual's life.

Clearly, being a volunteer is not only advantageous for society but also literates an individual at younghood to become a responsible and considerate citizen."
Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some people think that teenagers should do community work, which is unpaid, in their free time as good way to give the community some benefits. Furthermore, it can be argued that teenagers will obtain many valuable experiences in communication with others by engaging in community service.

The majority of teenagers need to learn how to communicate with others in the best way and how to do many things. Firstly, when some teenagers volunteer to clear parks, streets, or beaches, they will feel happy. Therefore, they will clean their rooms to get happiness. Secondly, many teenagers should do basic work without getting money to can be independent in the future. For example, when some teenagers cook at a restaurant, they will obtain many information of cooking which is good for them in the future. Finally, many people want money for their work, but when teenagers do not get any money for their working, they will normally do unpaid work.

On the other hand, the community receives benefits from unpaid work, so people and teenagers who have free time should do volunteer work which is something which improves their community. Furthermore, unpaid work benefits the relationships in the community which will expand cooperation and lead to improvements in community members’ lives.

 In conclusion, there are many opinions about unpaid work by teenagers who have free time, but in my opinion, I agree with working without getting money since that work improve the community."
Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The younger generation is the backbone of our society. I totally agree that teenagers should be required to do community work in their free time. They should be taught from a very young age about the importance of community service and how it will help the humanity as well as their own development. 

One of the ways in which this can be done is by having schools and colleges include community service as a part of their curriculum. They can have their students do say twenty hours or so of community service each month other than their regular study course. They can provide them with different options each month be it serving at a senior citizens home or orphanage or volunteering to clean the neighbouring roads or parks. Community service will help the teens to be more responsible. They will inculcate belongingness to the community. This will also learn teamwork and leadership skills by working with others. 

Community service will help the community in many ways. It will also reduce the pressure on the government manpower to upkeep the society as they will have helpers helping them. It will also make the maintenance work quicker due to increased manpower. It will also help keep the surrounding clean. The younger generation can also bring in their creativity in community service, which will help both the community and themselves.

To conclude, because community service will not only build responsible citizens and develop their personality, but it will also benefit the community, it is essential to let the youngsters do community work in their free time."
"Some people think that all teenagers should be required to do unpaid work in their free time to help the local community. They believe this would benefit both the individual teenager and society as a whole.
Do you agree or disagree?","Unpaid work could be a useful activity for all people. Many people believe that all young people should be needed to carry out unpaid work in their spare time to assist the local community. In my opinion, the participation of young people in unpaid work could bring some benefits, however they  should not be enforced to do this.

There are many benefits for the young people that can be obtained if they perform  unpaid work to help local communities. Firstly, young people would meet the society more often and they will know each other. This makes them have better communication and increases their willingness to help each other. Secondly, this kind of activity would be able to improve their skill that might be useful at work. For example, young people who work in a nursing home can improve their skills in nursing. Thirdly, young people are encouraged to do more positive activities in their spare time. For example, it is better to teach children in an orphanage home rather than watching TV all weekend. Finally, young people would be able to learn traditional values from the older generations that are still relevant in today's world, such as humility, charity, respect for the elderly and care for environmental issues.

However, the idea of involving young people in unpaid work should not be mandatory for all people. Instead of pushing them to do unpaid work, I believe it would be better that they should be free to decide to do the unpaid work. The reason is if they are not happy to do the unpaid work, this will affect the productivity and safety act at work. Encouraging young people to participate in unpaid work activities is a better idea.

In conclusion, I do believe that the participation of young people to do unpaid work to help local communities will provide many benefits both for the teenager and the society. However, it would be more appropriate to encourage young people rather than forced them."
Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Society has given a lot of things to humankind; it is our moral responsibility to give back to it. However, there is a bunch of groups who think youth should spend their leisure time working for society without getting paid. My opinion doesn’t stand with this. In the forthcoming paragraphs, One is going to discuss both views and evolve a conclusion from them.

To begin with, Many elderly people are living on their own. Due to some unavoidable circumstances, be it education or career, the kids have to move out of the house and the parents become helpless. There are many times when they need some helping hand. For example, buying medicine or helping them buy groceries for them. At such time, These volunteers can be like boons to them. It gives volunteers an opportunity to work for society and at the same time, the aged people can save their pension money.

On the contrary, Every small work done by the youth for society should be acknowledged moreover, if the acknowledgment is being given in terms of remuneration then it can motivate teenage. For instance, If a teenager spends their weekends working for some needy people and if they are getting paid for the same then they can use that fund to purchase books or even to pursue some skills or course. Secondly, This also helps them develop a sense of responsibility, and the learnings from it can be used in their life

To conclude, Every small piece of work should be appreciated. How will you feel if you spend an entire day at the office without getting paid? Similarly, If teenagers are contributing to society then they should get paid. In my opinion, small gestures can motivate other hundreds of other teenagers too."
Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefilt teenagers and community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"This is arguable that teenagers should do unpaid community volunteer work in their free time. I totally agree with this statement as it could be an opportunity for teenagers to learn and develop the skills from doing unpaid work as well as to serve the community which they live in.

 On one hand, there are many benefits for teenagers to learn and prepare to do the future work in the real world by doing unpaid community work. For example, firstly, teenagers will get an idea on how to use their knowledge and apply the skills they have learnt from the school in real work by doing community work such as school events. Secondly, these community works could help them to develop communication skills which they could use after graduation. Thirdly, they could get connection of many people in the community while they are doing unpaid community work. The connections they got could lead them to get a paid work when they finish from the school and start to look for a job.

On the other hand, it is arguable that they could do paid work during their free time instead of doing volunteer work. Firstly, the paid work will help them to get more money and they could help to support their family for daily and living expenses.  Secondly, they could learn to manage the money while they are doing paid work. This could help them to learn the money management skill which they could use this skill to manage their daily life in the future.

In conclusion, in my opinion, it may not be necessary to get teenagers to do the paid work while they are studying at the school. They could learn the skills for work while they are doing unpaid work without getting high pressure from work."
Some people think that all teenagers should be required to do unpaid work in their free time to help the local community. They believe this would benefit both the individual teenager and society as a whole. Do you agree or disagree?,"Many young people work on a volunteer basis, and this can only be beneficial for both the individual and society as a whole. However, I do not agree that we should therefore force all teenagers to do unpaid work for several reasons. 

Most young people are already under enough pressure with their studies, without being given the added responsibility of working in their spare time. School is just as demanding as a full-time job, and teachers expect their students to do homework and exam revision on top of attending lessons every day. When young people do have some free time, we should encourage them to enjoy it with their friends or to spend it doing sports and other leisure activities. They have many years of work ahead of them when they finish their studies.

At the same time, I do not believe that society has anything to gain from obliging young people to do unpaid work. In fact, I would argue that it goes against the values of a free and fair society to force a group of people to do something against their will. Doing this can only lead to resentment amongst young people, who would feel that they were being used, and parents, who would not want to be told how to raise their children. Currently, nobody is forced to volunteer, and this is surely the best system.

In conclusion, teenagers may choose to work for free and help others, but in my opinion, we should not make this compulsory."
Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"According to some people teenagers should be working to gratis community work in their free time. One of the biggest reasons of that reason is teenagers are more productive than old people and also they are stronger than old individuals as bodyly. But I don't think it's right that they don't take money. Both of these viewpoints will be outlined in detail before reaching conclution.

On the one hand, teenagers usually catch future trends which is being talked up about improved of tecnology such as metaverse because of posibilty of needed professions in the future. Thus, if they boost by governments, they can be success and productive for thier countries. Furthermore, they could informate to others with unpaid about culturel problems. For instance, many individuals do not know how can survived earthquake. they can teach easly to old humans.

On the other hand, teenagers who work free need get money to survive their life so they should earn some money what the consequences will be. Otherwise some of employers may use them negatively. For example, when recent graduates start to work thier new job, the employers usually have it made everything although they are not responsible. so their selfconvidence will be able to decrease day by day in many countries.

To sum up, teenagers who work at an early age will effects positively to community and they will improve themselves but they should earn money for their labor. they are both morale and try to do their best."
"Some people think that all teenagers should be required to do 

unpaid work in their free time to help the local community. They

as a whole. Do you agree or disagree?","While it's believed by some people that young adults participating in unpaid work in their leisure time would benefit them as individuals and the community in general, I indeed think that teenagers should be integrated into such activities from such young age, which empower their sens of citizenship and  responsibility towards the society.

Firstly, teenage-hood is a critical time in the person's life, so participating in unpaid community work would benefit these teenagers. in other words, they learn that they are part of this society so they take responsibility in keeping problem-free. For instance, if children are given a work of collecting the neighberhood's wastes, they will learn that keeping the road clean falls into them and that wastes should be disposed in a proper way. Therefore, youngesters should be engaged in local activities since it shapes there personnalities to grow into a good citizen in the future.

Secondly, those non-paid activities made by these young adults, the society will thrive. To put it differently, empowering society comes from its citizens, moreover working in groups provides an atmosphere of solidarity and togetherness. For example, teenagers are learning how to care and respect for those who are in need while working in a school of endicaped people. social work raise the awareness and empathy of youngest, these is why it should be requiered.

 in conclusion, there are many good reasons why unpaid community work must be introduced at a such young age, since it not only help them grow personaly but also it is the hope for a bright future and the society's prosperity."
Some people believe that teenager should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time . This can be benefit teenagers and the community as well . To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The question of what teenagers should do in their free time is still under discussion. A certain part of society panders over that it will be helpful if youngsters did unpaid public work at that period. Though it could be reasonable in some circumstances I believe that youth should have a choice how to spend their spare time.

On the one hand, starting working at a young age has some advantages. For instance, it helps to become a more responsible, disciplined, conscious person. Also, voluntary work is useful for the community. In some areas, such as cleaning the streets some additional help will never be useless. 

On the other hand, teenagers have already done their work studying in school. It is a challenging period and everyone deserve to have a rest. When I was this age I did my best at school, tried very hard. Maybe even more than when I started to work.

Besides, maybe the right decision will be to give them an alternative. Parents or teachers could explain to teens the benefit of public work is. It could be really quality time with their mates and they could get new skills. And after that youngsters make their own decision. If I was told in my high school that it is possible to do, I would definitely take this opportunity.

In conclusion, although there is the objective advantage requiring teens to work for the community without paying, I suppose that we need to give them a choice and decide by themselves how to spend their free time."
Some people believe that teenager should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can be benefit teenagers and the community as well.,"In the contemporary era, of uncompensated work, which was always debatable, has now become more controversial with many people claiming that it is beneficial for both teenagers and the community. The significant influence of this trend has sparked arguments about its potential impact in recent years. However, in my opinion, this statement appears to be more rational, and therefore, I agree to a large extent with this trend. This essay will further elaborate on my view favoring positive impact, and thus will lead to a logical conclusion.

There are plethora of arguments in favour of my stance. The most preponderant one is that it inculcates a sense of brotherhood eary in the soul which purifies the hearts. To explain, teen age is the age of learning new things. If they spend their their lisure time to work unpaid, they are likely to become virtue person. Furthermore, this trend put seed of brotherhood in their behaviour, which will develop a helping nature. Apart from this unpaid work in community provide them myriad of platform to show their talent. For instance, more then 90% of family surveyed in London agree to the fact that the nighbourhood duty helped the children to a great extent. 

Another striking assent of this trend is that it impact whole community to developed. In other words, it can help the communities to develop more on social as well as economic level because through their great helping work the social image of community will increase not only this but it also impact the revenue of countries as the works done with out expenditure. Besides this, it can reduce the number of crime, robberies, unethical involvements and sexual harassments such as rape cases. This is because it will develop a well-educated citizens. 

On the flip side, there are folk who have a different perception. They believe that it cannot be beneficial in the long term for students. Firstly, They will lose out on the opportunities to earn money which makes them financially independent. Secondly, with financial support, the youngsters gain confidence in the activity. For example, according to the New Yourk Times, the students who earned money early in their growth, have grater chances of success in life. 

In conclusion, although there are few damage on their financial state and confidence, the advantage of this surpase. Therefore, my opinion on this is optimistic to large extent because of their moral development as well as social & economic advantage of the country."
Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent to do you agree or disagree.,"Humans have the tendency of ruining things that benefits them, that is how they treat Mother Nature.Sapiens actions are adversely affecting the ecosystem resulting in deprivation of flora and fauna and vanishing of diverse species.In the following ,paragraph I will try to explain the main reason behind this cause and possible solutions. 

The main reason behind the decreased  biodiversity is overexploitation. Extreme hunting and fishing practice have made it difficult for species to reproduce which results in limited availability of animals and sometimes leads to the extinction of certain species ,For example, Every weekend group of friends gather for fishing to spend some time together, since these activities are taking places in regular intervals it does not allow fishes to give birth to their offsprings, thus it affects the ecosystem and creates a loss of biodiversity. 

The possible solution for this cause is to apply visiting restrictions by the government.The government should take  charge of such ponds where fishing is allowed and make it available to the general public  once in 6 months this will provide more time for fishes and other animals to reproduce which may result in an increased number of their breed. For instance, Dubai miracle garden have a diversity of flowers and since it has limited opening months It provides enough time for other plants and flowers to grow around them which remain intact and extinction of a particular type in such cases is least to impossible. 

In conclusion, excessive hunting and fishing are one of the major reasons that result in loss of biodiversity , however this can be controlled if the government takes the matter in their own hand and set up some restrictions."
Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is often argued that adolescents have to do free work for the community they live in during their spare time. It is believed that both the community and the teenagers will gain benefit from this. This essay agrees with the statement because volunteering helps the youth to gain life experiences and it also allows society to reap the benefit of it in different aspects of their everyday life.

Nowadays, most people aged 13 to 19 years old are willing to do free work to help others in need. They believe that by doing this, it will make them better members of the society, besides the fact that volunteering may be a massive plus in their curriculum when applying for a degree. To put it in other words, voluenteering seems to be one of the top contributing factors in achieving higher scores in psycho-social tests undertaken for students before applying for college. For example, univerisities such as UCL or KCL receive plenty of applications by excellent students, albeit they tend do accept the ones who have spent time in helping others in a way or another through volunteering. 

On the other hand, the community needs people to help them in different aspects of their everyday life. In other words, some might need a person to help with cleaning the streets of the neighbour, some others might need people to direct kids to cross the road from one end to the other.Aa great illustration of this is that, in some towns near Liverpool, a campain was launched by the local government to look for volunteers so elderlies in nursing homes can spend some quality time with youngsters.

To conclude, not only these adolescents will help themselves by improving their social skills or by being admitted in top universities, the community will also reap a considerable benefit by youngsters of the society."
Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent to do agree or disagree?,"Some say that adolescents should work in society without pay in their leisure time. This is benficial for both, the community and youth.  This essay totally agrees with this statement as working without salary provides experience and many community works are completed without any cost.

To begin with, when teenagers do any community work without getting any money in return, they get the chance to get experience which is helpful for them to get a job later in the life after completing education. This job experience helps to make their resume stronger than others who do not have any experience and employers prefer to select someone who has some work experience or any volunteer experience. For example, in a recent survey by the university of Saskatchewan, 30% of students who have some community work experience  got jobs immediately after graduating.

Furthermore, when a job is done by adolescents free of cost in the society, it decreases the financial burden on the local government as the government does not need to hire people on wages to do the same task. Therefore, spred money is used to provide other essential services in the community. For instance, according to an article in The Local News newspaper,  20% of the total money spend on the care of water parks in Melfort city comes from the funds saved as a result of work done by teens during their free time which otherwise could cost thousands of dollars.

In conclusion, community service done by the youth without any penny during their leisure time has advantages to the adolescents as well as to the society."
Some people believe that all teenagers should have to do unpaid work during their free time in order to help the local community. They think this would benefit the teenagers doing the unpaid work but also society as a whole. Do you agree or disagree?,"Although there is no doubt that volunteering is a crucial part of our life, it is important to consider how society can raise awareness about it. There are numerous people who believe that it is inevitable to start doing work without a pension . Personally, I am a vehement supporter of the idea of volunteering.

Apparently, there are a plethora of boons enrolling in volunteering activities. First off, it helps juveniles improving their future career. This is an advantage because teenagers will gain more experience by dealing with others, and they will be aware of how the market is. For example, according to The Times, 70% of adolescents who were part of unpaid work during their university education are getting promoted faster in their work. In contrast, students who prefer to not enrol in any unpaid job face tremendous pitfalls, not solely in their industry, but also in their personal life. In addition, their communication skills will be dwindled down, which can suppress their interpersonal artistry, time-management techniques and leadership skills.

Secondly, there are abundant programs for student exchange. Participating in such programs can broadening student's horizon because they will be surrounded by cultural diversity. To clarify, the student will be able to learn a new language, new culture and gain experience. As a result, this will impact the youngster's confidence, as well as his self-growth, which will affect substantially his society.

In conclusion, having explored both vantage points, I wholeheartedly agree that universities should come up with an idea to include volunteering as a compulsory subject."

To what extent do you agree or disagree.","Children are the backbone of every country.So, there are people who tend to believe that youngsters should be encouraged to initiate social work as it will result in flourished society and the individual growth of youngsters themselves. I, too believe that this motivation has more benefits than its drawbacks.

To begin with,  social work with children can be easily associated with personality development because during this drive, they tend to communicate with a variety of people, leads to polished verbal skills. For example, if they start convincing rural people to send their children in school they have to be such a convincing attitude along with developed verbal skills to deal with diverse kind of people there. This improved skill will help them lifelong in every arena. Apart from this, the true values of life like tolerance,patience,team spirit,cooperation can be learnt. Besides that, young mind serves the country with full enthusiasm that gives them feeling of fulfilment and self satisfaction. This worthiness for themselves brim them with self confidence and patriotic feeling.Moreover, going and experiencing multiple culture and tradition make their horizon, so broad that add one more feather in their cap.

However, It is truly said, no rose without thrones. Can the drawbacks of this initiation be ignored? Children go to school, participate in different curriculum activities, endure the pressure of peers, parents, and teachers and in the competitive world they should not be expected to serve society without their self benefits. This kind of pressure might bring resentment in their mind.

In conclusion, I believe, notion of teenagers doing unpaid work is indeed good, but proper monitoring and care should be given to avoid untoward consequences."
Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent to do you agree or disagree.,"Doing voluntary jobs is one of many ways to contribute in society's development. Nowadays, many youngsters are devoting their leisure time into the community welfare activities which not only help them to have a real life experience, but also give them a chance to work for the humanity. Therefore, it is imperative to know whether  beneficial or not. While adolescents are not earning anything from such activities, I believe that voluntarism develops the teenager's personality and reduces a society's disparity.

Indeed, working for nonprofit organizations, the young ones come across with different communities and experienced professionals, whom they can learn the dynamics of works. Juveniles enhance the communication skills by socialization as well as enable leadership qualities, to take part in communal clubs, thereby they get that healthy environment, which is essential for their mental capabilities. For instance, in the USA, many young people are participating in the public welfare events during the summer's and winter's vacations to acquire the practical knowledge that can aid them in future when they would start searching for a job. Thus, the young blood can be trained for the prospective challenges what anticipate in the coming period.

Furthermore, different background teenagers take part in this noble cause without making money that brings them close to each others. Throughout the activities, all members of communal groups have been treated as equal by the equal responsibilities and rights remove the inequality among them. Referring to a previous example, in the USA, young bodies is being worked in a togetherness that is essential to drive smoothly the multicultural USA life style. Hence, to achieve the country's stability, it is pertinent young citizens put some time in the community works.

In conclusion, it is vital to encourage young citizens to indulge in philanthropy's occupations. Taking part in the local welfare events leads an individual having a strong character and well-managed nation due to this, I strongly in the favour of youngsters' volunteering work decision."
"Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well.
To what extent do you agree or disagree.","It is true that youngsters are considered the building blocks of a nation and they play a vital role in serving the society as they are full of energy not only mentally but physically also. some people think that youth should do voluntary work for the community in their free time as it will be beneficial for both of them. I agree with the statement as it has wide range of benefits which will be discussed in the further essay.
On the one hand, adolescents can do a lot of unpaid activities and make their spare time a fruitful one. Firstly, they can teach underprivileged children as they are unable to afford the school education. This in turn help the youngsters to gain a lot of experience and help them in future perspective. Secondly, youth can involve in some philanthropic activities by cleaning their localities and planting trees, this helps them to become responsible towards society and enhance their social skills.
On the other hand, some disagree teenagers should do unpaid work. One reason is that the mounting pressure our education system puts on studying for exams leaves little time for students to pursue other activities. After school, homework and revision takes priority which leaves no time for other things. Another important factor is that youngsters like to have free time to develop their hobbies and interest. These voluntary works would eat up their free time.
In conclusion, despite having certain drawbacks of education pressure and lack free time to improve their extra-curricular activities, I strongly agree voluntary work would help teenagers to a greater extent in long run. This would help them to understand the importance of hard work, team building, social bonding and make them a better person. Both parents and teachers should encourage teens to take part in serving the community in free time."
Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well.,"I agree with the question statement to a great extent. I believe that teenagers should be required to do volunteer work in their leisure time in their community. This would have a number of positive effects as it would benefit the teenagers and their neighbourhood simultaneously. Overall, a sense of caring and productive use of teenager’s schedule would be seen.
To begin with, teenagers would spend some hours from their schedule doing righteous and virtuous work instead of playing video games and wasting their time on other activities. This would greatly impact their personality and they would develop a sense of kindness and care towards other people. For example, if the teenagers help people around them in need of moral and emotional support; this would be a source of self-contentment for them. Moreover, it would inculcate a feeling of empathy towards the needy people.
In addition to the impact of this on the teenagers themselves, it would also create a good impression and a sense of unity and harmony in the local neighbourhood. Thus, people would develop a notion that others around them care and respect them. To be particular, it would help  older people who have difficulty in carrying out their chores. Consequently, the aged would transfer their experience and knowledge to the teenagers which would be very beneficial for them.
Concluding the discussion, I would like to suggest that schools should adopt this approach in their curriculum for teenagers to spend their time doing community service. This would not only benefit a particular person, but the community as a whole."
Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free times. This can benefit teenagers and benefit the community as well.,"
It is important to consider how teenagers contemplate between free and busy hours. While some people contend that teenagers should involve in free social works during those free hours, other deem that it is trivial. I tend to partially agree with the former argument, and in this essay I will support my view with argument examples.
To begin, teenagers should involve in community service because it makes them social. This is because social works are usually gratifying and enlivening; also, teenagers could build rapport in the society. For instance, they can utilize their spare time and embark on a new relation, which is integral for safety and companionship need. However, if teenagers do not involve in social service, they may lack support during emotional turmoil. This happens because there is no one to support them during such ordeal.
To put in a nutshell, since there are some obvious merits of teenager’s involvement in social work such as it is exhilarating and invigorating, teens should engage in community work without financial motivation. Personally, I would involve in social service during free times.
To put in a nutshell, although there are obvious merits of teenager’s involvement in social work such as it is exhilarating and invigorating, we must take in consideration their need for refreshment and involvement in other sectors. Personally, I tend to partially support the argument that teens should engage in community work; I would involve in social service during free times."
Employers should give their staff at least a 4-week holiday a year to make employees better at their jobs. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, the employers and public developers have been working hard to determine holiday allocation for their employees. Some argued that staff should have a rest for a month every year, although this leads to some positive impacts, but I completely disagree about this statement.

It is true that the prolonging holidays have some advantages. First, since this tendency will provide personnel with more time to release stress after a long period of working, such as travelling or participating in recreational activities. For instance, the employees would adjust themselves to work after a rest and eventually improve their work efficiency. Secondly, if the employees have more time to take care of their babies, they would be more willing to devote their energy to their working processes, In fact, if the staff have the life satisfaction, they would only focus on careers, which is a conducive environment for the corporations' development to increase

On the other hand, the policy of extending holidays will also lead to some drawbacks, which can put  the business of the companies at stake.  By the time the holiday ends, the employees' mental and physical abilities become passive since it took them a long date without exposing to their regular tasks such as typing a report or conducting a research. As a result, this leads to the fact that the capacity in the working environment is not effective and affect badly the company's achievement. Furthermore, the small companies, which has few employees, could have to delay the deadline of certain projects. This leads to the fact that the capacity in the working environment is not effective and affect badly the company's achievement. 

In conclusion, since there are some advantages of the long holidays, therefore the bosses can offer employees about two-week holiday to boost staff morale and enhance cooperation and efficient working processes."
"There are several factors that motivate people to stay in the workforce, and money is the most important reason/factor. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","many people belive that money is a major key to consider a job to be worthy. While it is true that money is important , other main reasons must be considered along with it. Nontheless this essay displays that money alone can not be the only main factor.

On one hand , it is widely accepted by majority of people that with money not all but most of things can be accessable. Due to the offers that market tries to decieve us with , it is impossible to live without money. For example , the costs of accommodation and studying this days have highly increased. Furthermore, the need of being observed is another fact nowadays , therefore most of the people care about there performance in public which requiers good clothing that costs alot. According to many articles, not only money is an important factor , but it is also needed to get a job in the first place since because most of the time , a university degree is needed to apply  for a job filed and costs of leaning are not cheap.

On the other hand , a job is something that people doing it must get a satisfaction from and its not possible only by money. For instance, most of humans have a need for being respected in public which is something that wealth has little to do with it. Another factor would be the working time and free time for the workers. Based on a report made by Washington post , over 80 percent Men and Women who were happy with their job , had a boundary between their workplace and free time at their house.

In conclusion , it can be said that eventhough money plays an important role on a job value , it is not the main factor and other reasons must be considered along with it."
"There are several factors that motivate people to stay in the workforce, and money is the most important reason/factor. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is a general perception that monetary gain is the most significant driving force that keeps an employee or an entrepreneur working. However, in my opinion, this is certainly not the only reason to keep it up.

To begin, Happiness and self-contentment while working are the most underrated but paramount measures. For instance, a person who feels truly satisfied carries on with his performance quite consistently and efficiently. On contrary, if he is not content working, money alone cannot put him together any longer and he might switch his current job for a desired one.

Secondly, the nature of tasks and personal moral values should not be contradictory. This means that a person can only carry on with his effort if it falls within his moral limits and virtuous boundaries. For example, A man with the right upbringing and values cannot stay longer on an earning platform which is not legit.  In other words, those banknotes cannot be a consistent motivation in a situation like this.

Thirdly, mental well-being is as important as physical strength. One cannot perform better with compromised mental strength. Moreover, no amount of money can attract him. The working environment matters to some people more than financial values. These are the righteous kind of people who are enough considerate of their mental well-being. They cannot function in a sick or toxic environment where dirty politics is being played and there is no act of justice or fairness served.

To conclude, although, one cannot deny the importance of financial statistics, the attributes like self-satisfaction, happiness, mental fitness and quality of work are equally or in some cases more important."
"There are several factors that motivate people to stay in the workforce, and money is the most important reason/factor. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Some people argue that  salary is the essential key to retaining workers in a company. In my view, though in the past it would be true, I am truly convinced that in our modern era, it is not the main factor. In this essay,  I will first discuss the place of money in our society and second, I will discuss today's key factor.

To begin with, nobody can deny the fact that the level of wages is an important reason in the making-decision process of choosing one job instead of another. It is universally acknowledged that money determines the social level of people and their importance in  society. According to a recent Australian survey, 20% of people considered that salary was the main motivation to wake them up every day.

However, this percentage has drastically decreased over a 10-year period. Nowadays, how much people get paid is not the main tool to take on applicants anymore, one  factor has overcome it.

First of all, in an era in which we have been seeing people quitting high-paid jobs, individuals don't want to be driven by money anymore. Instead, people are currently seeking jobs that offer them the to contribute to  community development. Diving deeper, while office-job companies are experiencing issues to hire candidates, the number of craft-jobs applicants is booming. According to the website Seek.com, crafts jobs applications rose by 30% over the last 5 years. 

To sum up, money is still an important factor for job seekers. However, nowadays, the implication of the job in the well-being community has become the highest reason."
"There are several factors that motivate people to stay in the workforce, and money is the most important reason/factor. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","There is no dought that people stay employed due to many factors, and money has been considered the most essential reason to remain in the same job. In my opinion, I completely disagree with this statement and I am going to elaborate on my perspective in the following paragraph.

First and foremost, job satisfaction is considered to be a major contributor to office's enthusiasm, due to the fact that doing what you love makes your activities or test easier and more interesting. In other words, it gives you the feeling of pleasure, which can help you get rid of stress got in the workplace. Take my mother as an example, she is an elementary school teacher and has been teaching English for over 30 years. Although she only earned a little money, she took delight in it. Because she really likes to teach children and was also highly respected by her students. As a consequence, satisfaction plays a significant role in putting more effort into performance.

Furthermore, the atmosphere at work is also one of the crucial causes to be in the workplace. Working with friendly colleagues and a well boss can boost employees' confidence and happiness  because it creates a comfortable working environment without coworker pressure. For example, despite my workplace being extremely far from my home, my colleagues are so kind that I decided to stay and work with them. Therefore, people ignore unpleasant factors when they are working in a great team.

In conclusion, cash motivates a part of society to work. However, satisfaction and the working environment also have an important impact."
"In recent years, responsible tourists have paid attention to preserving both the culture and the environment of the place they visit. However, some people say that it is impossible to be a responsible tourist. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In the present era, a growing number of people travel around the world, it became a trend. Thus, some suggested that it is tourists' responsibility to protect the civilization and surroundings of the destinations, however, this suggestion is impossible to keep. I strongly disagree with the statement. 

On the one hand, visitors are more likely to be responsible for the protection local environment as long as the governments can actively implement policies. For example, visitors are not daring to litter everywhere in Singapore since the harsh penalty launched by its government. Another similar example can be found in China. The government released a regulation about littering around at anyone, including visitors, who violates the rule may pay a fine. Such policies can force people to protect the local environment while travelling.

On the other hand, how culture can be valued and preserved depends on visitors’ awareness. If people had the access to local cultures before their trip, they would aware of the importance of the civilization and would not destroy them on purpose. For instance, if you searched the local history and culture or watched a documentary before travelling to the destination, you would be very aware of the cultural differences between your own culture and others, thus making you accountable for the prevention of the local civilization and history.

In conclusion, based on the above evidence and analysis, tourists can be accountable for the preservation of the culture and the environment of the destinations through policies and beforehand information preparation."
Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people while others believe that the purpose of museum is to educate. Discuss both views and give you own opinion.,"These days, museums are built in every big city and Many arts in the past and the present are shown. Many people believe that museum should be the place we go to enjoy while some people think it is the place for learning. It is argued about the goal of visiting museum. We will discuss two opinions in following paragraphs.

To begin with the start of building museum, they are built for collect arts in one room and they up their size bigger until today. There are a lot of history pictures in many era as well as they have descriptions near the picture to read and learn. Each arts are drawn in different techniques, artists should to learn about them to improve their drawing skills.

However, there are much knowledge to learn in there but some people just enjoy go to only watch it, it make they feel good when they were looking at a beautiful picture. In difficult day, we can go to museum and we can see they make us feel better. We can go to take a picture of people and art for feeling free. Moreover, there are shops for sell arts, many people want to buy them for their need.

In conclusion, many people is argue that the purpose to go art park, It is argued that they for enjoy or learn. I agree with the people who think art park is the place for entertainment. We go to there and watch pictures to make us feel calm."
"Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people, while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","There has been much discussion revolving around the issue of whether the places of museums should entertain people or only educate. In this essay, I will explain both possessions and I am going to tell my belief about this discussion.

The primary factor we need to take into consideration is that museums must be amusing place where people get entertained. First and most importantly museums need to make money. To do that their exhibitions can’t be boring. The workers of this institutions have to figure out how to make their museum stand out from all the others, make it unique to attract visitors. This would led to making bigger profits, which allow to invest into museum facilities also it would help raise workers' wages. The second reason why museums should bring joy, and not only educate is that museums have to be interesting and understandable for people of all ages, especially for children. Getting young people to focus on learning is difficult these days. Therefore, one of the goals of museums must be to combine education with entertainment and teach children, otherwise they will simply be bored and uninterested. In contrast, some others may claim that the only purpose of museums is to educate human beings. Museums reveal to us past events or help us understand other world cultures. We have to respect history and other nations, so depicting these things through an entertainment view would not be mature.

Having considered both views, I think museums need to have balance. I mean it should be enjoyable, entertaining and educational at the same time."
"Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people, while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Some people argue that museums ought to be a place for recreational purposes, while others argue that museums ought to be used solely for educating people. Museums can be used to attract tourists which will benefit the country in the end as it can flourish the economy. In contrast, museums are imperative to educate the public about their art, history and culture. In my opinion, museums should be used for both educational and entertainment purposes.

To begin with, museums attract numerous tourists from all around the globe. From an economic perspective, museums generate job opportunities in the market and contribute to the growth of the local economy because of tourists, which will benefit the nation in the end. A museum where people could enjoy and entertain attracts more people than other museums. There are museums where it is not only about history or art, such as the kimchi museum in South Korea and the chocolate museum in Belgium. Hence, since these museums are quite popular among international tourists, museums should be a place to entertain people. 

On the contrary, museums play a crucial role in educating the public about art, history, science, culture among others. Moreover, it is imperative for educating future generations about their history, culture and roots. Thus, museums are undoubtedly a huge source of knowledge, so it ought to be solely used for educational purposes.

In conclusion, museums and entertainment purpose both for educational and entertainment purposes. From an economic point of view, enjoyable museums attract a significant number of tourists which will eventually benefit the country, while it is also a huge source of knowledge and plays an important role in educating people about art, history and culture."
"Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people,
while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate.
Discuss both views and give you own opinion.","Museums have always been a place of attraction for tourists. Some people consider this place as a source of entertainment while others believe it is a place of gaining abundance of knowledge. This essay will discuss both sides of argument and will provide an evidence as to why these exhibitions should be called more reliable resource of education.  

Admittedly, Museums are a place where people of all ages can lavishly enjoy their time. There are a large number of cities who have made plethora of investments in these museums in order to make them enticing for today's generation. They charge certain amounts to tourists and provide them numerous facilities so that they can spend their leisure time enjoying these arts. There is no doubt that it should be a great way to release boredom and do something different as opposed to daily schedules. People tend to see ample of traditional equipment, objects which they find very interesting. For instance, India's capital Delhi gives a great opportunity to its visitors to pay attention to the large numbers of exhibits as a source of entertainment at very minimal cost. Therefore, these exhibitions surely give people a chance to have fun with their beloved ones. 

On the other hand, we must not forget the advantages of having these places with an educational point of view. Today's youth show a great interest in the history and these places provide them a chance to enhance their knowledge with regard to the ancient times. They get to know more about the science as well as customs of nation. Recently, a survey was performed in one of the universities, India and it has shown that 58% of the students admitted the fact that Museums are very helpful providing them education related to the old times. Furthermore, by getting this information, children find more interest in their studies just because they actually experience the same in a variety of exhibitions. Practical knowledge always helps all of them in remembering histories rather than learned skills. 

To recapitulate with, while Museums are considered to be fascinating places for everyone in terms of entertainment, their importance towards education can not be neglected."
"Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people, while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate.  Discuss both views and give you own opinion.","The role of museums in our lives has been widely debated. Opinions differ as to whether the role of museums is solely limited to entertain us or as a means of education. In this essay, I will not only discuss both sides, but also provide my viewpoint while concluding this.

To begin with, these galleries serve people in getting rid of their boredom. To elaborate, nowadays, people tend to get tired very easily, owing to their monotonous lifestyles. In order to mitigate this weariness, these archaeological places can serve as a one of the many options for them to explore and rejuvenate.

 Red Fort, for instance, is frequently visited by tourists and local people as a leisure activity.

Conversely, these museums are the symbol of our cultural history, identity, and traditions. Visiting these places helps people to broaden their horizon and enhance their knowledge about their ancestral roots. According to an article published in ""THE TIMES"", the students who explored these sites as their history assignment, achieved more success than other students in their exams. Besides this, feeling proud about their identity is an another possible reason. Because of the globalisation the world has become a smaller place, these places serves as a medium to connect people to their traditional roots,and also develop a social bond between them. As a result, they are proud of their national identities and its values.

To conclude, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe museums have an equally important role to serve as a leisure activity as well as for education, and people have sole right to decide upon what they want to do."
"The use of social media ,such as Face book and Twitter ,is replacing face_to_face contact with people. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?","Face-to-face interaction with individuals is being replaced by the usage of social media, such as Facebook and Twitter. Do the benefits outweigh the minus.
This essay illustrate that, the pros include speed and benefit, and the cons are the deprivation of live communication

First and foremost, the biggest benefit of social media is that it has shortened distances from hours to seconds. When there was no online environment people relied on phone calls or emails to communicate, and they frequently had to wait months or even years to see family members who were living away from home. However, with the introduction of various options like Facebook and Twitter, this has decreased the amount of time it takes to connect. Second, for politicians who blog, social networks have emerged as the most successful channel for reaching a large audience and, of course a good PR company.

In the following paragraph, we'll discuss how today's youth form friendships. The majority of children today only have online friendships, which makes it difficult for them to communicate in real time or express their emotions. Also on the Internet  teenagers feel their impunity and permissiveness because of this. There have been many cases of suicide due to cyberbullying of so-called haters

In conclusion the use of social media, has supplanted face-to-face engagement with people. Do the pros outweigh the minus, and this essay demonstrate that the advantages include quality and speed, but the disadvantages include the absence of live communication."
"Some people believe that children that commit crimes should be punished. Others think the parents should be punished instead.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Nowadays, individuals are need to earn more income to fulfil their requirements therefore they do not need to pay taxes to the government. I strongly agree with the above statement and my justification will come in further paragraphs along with some relative examples.

To commence with, there are several reasons why human beings not need to pay taxes. Firstly, they put extra hours and hardwork to earn money hence they should keep all the money for their better future. For instance, sometimes any misshepling occure that time they easily used their saving for any medical emergency and many more. Secondly, the living expenses of todays lives are very costly to adjust middle class to buy their dream house and car. Thirdly, education system and helathcare both are very expensive to affordable poor people therefore they do not need to pay the government.

Furthermore, individuals are less likely to pay taxes to the administration and used their saving in different fields such as education, healthcare and many more. Moreover, they need to some essential requirements in their life to survive long.

On the other hand, there are many advantages of paying taxes to the state. the government can easily provide them better education, good health infrastrure any many more facilities. Additionally, the state can manage their economy and budget very easily with the help of the money which they received from the local public.

To give an overview, folk should not pay taxes to the government because they need some extra money to survive long. However, the state should overcome taxes rates so all people can easily pay taxes."
"In many countries today, parents are able to choose to send their children to single-sex schools or co-educational schools. Some people think that children going to single-sex schools have disadvantages later in life. 

To what extent do you agree?","In some counties, parents teach their kids in single-gender school to make sure their kids will not be involved in a physical connection and sexual relationship. Moreover, they may only send children at 3-8 years to co-educating schools to improve their skills of the way to respect girls and behave with them in the future. 

Firstly, Some Fathers and mothers have their reasons to choose isolated-gender-school. it could be also related to their beliefs and they want for them a good life when they get older, so they can have their partner and make families. Likewise, send kids in unisex school could be risky which young boy may have a physical relationship with a classmate and get pregnant. Moreover, there are some cases for young students who get pregnant from school.  

On the other hand, co-educational schools have advantages for young students which could be helpful to study together with respect and understanding. Furthermore, A significant is the way parents explain to their kids what is right and what is wrong no matter if they will be in single-gender school or co-school and watch their behaves.

In conclusion, parents can send thier kids to any school they wants as long as it is helpful for children which it give them good knowledge and educate them who to behavior with both genders."
"In many countries today, parents are able to choose to send their children to single-sex schools or co-educational schools. Some people think that children going to single-sex schools have disadvantages later in life. 

To what extent do you agree?","Nowadays, parents prefer sending their children to same-sex or mixed-sex schools. Some of them say that if children go to single-sex schools, it will affect their future lives negatively.

While I concede that going to single-sex schools has some advantages for both girls and boys, I am mostly of the opinion that children should go to co-educational schools. 

In the contemporary era, parents want to create a relaxed environment for their children. Most 

Boys and girls feel safe with the same gender. That’s why people send their children to same-sex schools. On the other hand, gender stereotyping is rarely found in single-sex schools. Accordingly, there is no sex comparison among the pupils. Compared with co-educational schools, there is less bullying in the single-sex schools.

In comparison to these schools, the co-educational system has more advantages than a single-sex system. Free interaction with each other can help children live in society confidently and without hesitation.  Co-education also increases the possibility of communication skill improvement. Mixed-gender education may decrease negative thinking about the opposite gender. Co-education can help boost gender equality.

 

In conclusion, people make a choice between single-sex or mixed-gender education. To my mind, mixed-gender education has more positive effect on children's lives."
"In many countries today, parents are able to choose to send their children to single-sex schools or co-educational schools. Some people think that children going to single-sex school have disadvantages later in life. To what extent do you agree?","Nowadays in a lot of nations, pupils are being sent or single-gender or mixed educational institutions by their fathers and mothers. It is believed by some individuals that attending a one-sex institution may bring bad consequences in the lives of those boys and girls later on. The essay totally agrees with the viewpoint because studying separately from the opposite sex may bring some social problems to those boys and girls. Namely, they would have problems related to socialization and may have fewer friends than those who attend co-educational institutions. 

In the era of globalization, dividing youngsters do different types of schools based on their sex may affect negatively their future lives. They may have difficulties interacting with opposite genders. Some American socio-psychologists claim that those children who go to mixed-sex schools are more successful in their personal activities and jobs, while those individuals who go to single-sex institutions are less happy and are less fortunate in their careers. 

Another point is that it is very important to have more friends in one’s life  the first elements of which start from school years. Some statistics show that girls feel more comfortable and relaxed when they share their personal problems with males  rather than females. It means that the chance of having more friends from the school time must not be taken from children. 

In conclusion, I completely agree with the thinking that children going to single-gender schools have disadvantages in their future lives. Because it may really bring some challenges such as less socializing and making fewer friendships."
"In some countries, people are having children at later age in life. What are the reasons? Do the advantage outweigh disadvantages?","Raising kids at an old age might be a big hit in some countries. Although for some couple having new baby born bring them joy and pride as they are officially become new parents, we cannot pigeonhole the possibility of double-edged sword in terms of financial and mental issue if they are not well-prepared to handle this position. This essay will discuss about how raising kids in early age might bring parents to several drawbacks for their kids or even for their marriage harmony.

First and foremost, one of the major reasons why some couple decide raising kids at later age into consideration is owing to career settlement. This supporters believe, achieving their dreams in working or studying is way more a priority. In fact, having children might distract their goals since they have to grow and nurture their kids from day to day life. For instance, in South Korea where locals are facing a shrink of  birth fertility since  raising kids ost a lot of money. Parents should save their income for their kids' education, health and daily needs which makes them feel burden, compared just living as a couple.  Another assumption might related to quality time. This might ensue to some newlyled couple 

as they still comfortablle to spend honeymoon time the most with their partner before having kids.

However, raising kids at later age also have some drawbacks. As they are getting older, it can take a risk to give birth  and might cause women  in danger. Let us take example in Indonesia, where some women experience miscarriage as she give birth in 40-50 years old. If this phenomenon continues for long time, the fertility rate in country will be significantly decline and impact to the country's economy.

In conclusion, even though raising kids at old age can possibly risky for women, however, we have to consider the readiness of couples to bear the position as parents. Hence, both of them are ready financially and mentally to have kids after some consideration, it will also give  positive impacts to their babyborn  grow progress. Thus, the positive effect of having kids at later age definitely surpass the downside."
"In many countries today, parents are able to choose to send their children to single-sex schools or co-educational schools. Some people think that children going to single-sex schools have disadvantages later in life.
To what extent do you agree?","In this concurrent world, education is an essential part of everyone's life. The importance of co-educational schools has become controversial in recent times.Some people harbour concur that parents should enrol their children on co-education schools while other people have opposed to this  notion.In this essay, I will elaborate on the positive and negative aspects of these trends and thus lead to a logical conclusion.

There are adequate evidence are obtainable to substantiate reasons. The top-notch concrete reason is children attending to co-educational school which help them to perform well by compete with other genders in academic and non-academic records.Another infamy root is men are more arrogant by nature and considering women are less than men, to putting children to co-educational school which make them understand gender equality and treat them with care and respect. The rearmost coherent factor to be considered which cannot be neglected is most of  the jobs are mixes   of females and mens.After completed studies in co-eductional school, more easier  to communicate with other gender people without any regret.Thus, above stated reasons of co-educational school has uncertainly merits.

What is known as half full for some may appear as empty half to others. So people in general trends to distinguish that parent should send their children to single-sex schools which has multifarious reasons.Primarly, children don't distract on other things. To probe more deeply, boys had affecting towards girls which affect their concentration on studies. Besides, single-sex school has full of funs rather than co-educational school. In Addition, women are very comfortable and safer to study in single-sex institution. 

In recapitulation, I reiterate that there was  innumerable strong factor supporting that children attending co-educational school may  to chance reduce the rate of abuse case and as an individual more benefical to light up career in professional life. Consequently, I firmly agree with the given statement."
"In many countries today, parents are able to choose to sent their children to single-sex schools or co-educational schools. Some people think that children going to single-sex schools have disadvantages later in life. To what extend do you agree?","In most countries, parents have the option to choose if they want their children to study in single-sex schools or co-educational ones. The right choice amongst both options is a contentious argument. However, I opine that the kids should be sent to co-educational schools. In the below essay I will express my standpoints to elucidate further.

Firstly, the education system is the foundation of the future of any nation. The youth learns a lot about the basic social structures, morals and rights during their student life. Gender equality has been a problem since long ago and many nations are still struggling with it. Therefore, to aware citizens of the need to implement equality at the very beginning phase of learning. This will not just help the child to understand that there is no gender supremacy but it will also teach them to work together with girls. For instance, a boy studied from a school for boys may face difficulties dealing with female coworkers at the workplace due to many reasons. Whether it is not knowing how to behave or how to share space with them.

In addition to that, running an educational organization for specified genders seems a conservative approach. Earlier in countries like India, the right to education was more of a privilege. The male child was supposed to go to school and work, whereas, the daughters were told to stay home instead. The rationale behind this  was the mindset of the people who used to believe that women belong to the kitchen and they shouldn't be going out. To some extent for the parents, who still wanted their ladies to be educated, gender-specific schools were built. With the passage of ,time these stereotypes started to abolish but the practice of different academies is still in use. Though it gave a sense of security to the guardians that the environment in these institutions would be safer and they shouldn't hesitate due to any fear of mishappening. 

To conclude the given viewpoints, undoubtedly there are options for the begetters to enrol their grown-ups into the institute of their choice but co-education is more beneficial for them. It will not just help them to teach about fairness but also to grow in various aspects of life."
"In many countries today, parents are able to choose to send their children to single-sex schools or co-educational schools. Some people think that children going to single-sex schools have disadvantages later in life. To what extent do you agree?","Nowadays, parents can decide between having their children learn at single-sex schools and mixed-gender schools. It is considered by some that there are some drawbacks in the single-sex environment that affects students in the future. While I agree that single-sex schools could offer children disadvantages, I believe that whether they will be faced with the negative consequences depends to a large extent on the student.

Studying in a single-sex school could be detrimental to the student's development. One reason for this is that the students might not become prepared to work in the real world. Most people will work with others of different genders in their professions. However, single-sex classrooms do not provide youngsters with opportunities to interact with others who are of the opposite sex. This could lead to difficulties working effectively with coworkers in a workplace as students might lack the skills required for it. Another reason is that people generally learn better with diverse perspectives. There are several differences between males and females in how they think and feel because of the biological differences as well as the cultural perceptions toward each sex. This enables students to look at things from various viewpoints. For example, girls mature faster in general, which can offer fresh perspectives to boys in the classroom. 

Despite the downsides which I mentioned above, how attending single-sex schools will affect a child’s future varies from person to person. For instance, some individuals will be successful if they received more benefits than disadvantages of single-sex schools. Some of the benefits include a sense of security from being surrounded by similar people and lessons that are tailored to meet the needs of each sex. Another example would be those who have plenty of opportunities to communicate with peers of the opposing sex, namely through local sports clubs or community programmes. 

In conclusion, although it is true that a single-sex school could affect young people negatively when they get old, I think that there will be those who take advantage of it. It is advisable that parents weigh the pros and cons carefully before making a decision."
"In many countries today, parents are able to choose to send their children to single-sex schools or co-educational schools. Some people think that children going to single-sex schools have disadvantages later in life. To what extent do you agree?","Some people think that sending children to co-educational schools have more advantages than sending them to single-sex schools. It reflects in their later life. Although, it is the personal choice of parents to do so. But, in my opinion, children should go to co-educational schools only.

Co-education has many advantages. First of all, a common school for boys and girls reduces the burden on the government to provide the state with more schools. Additionally, when a child studies in a co-ed school, it helps him or her in boosting their self-esteem and social skills. Altogether, the better understanding of the diverse world where both the genders live together inculcates in them. 

Secondly, a free exchange of ideas between boys and girls give rise to a healthy relationship between two sexes. A free interchange of ideas between them would make them friends and good companions. Moreover, If the boys and girls study together they get a chance to learn about each other better. For Instance, girls are good at needlework, while boys are good at electronic gadgets, in which they can help each other whenever required.

Co-education should be encouraged right from the kindergarten so that child grows up with the right attitude towards life and opposite-sex children. Although, there are many schools in India where co-education is not a practice and they are quite successful in the long run. However, nowadays co-educational schools have started becoming popular.

To sum up, I believe that studying in a single-sex school does not prepare students for the real world. Children of such school encounter a lot of problems in life in areas of communication and confidence, compared to the one studying in the co-educational schools."
"In many countries today, parents are able to choose to send their children to single sex schools or co-educational schools. Some people think that children going to single –sex schools have disadvantages later in life.
 To what extent do you agree?","Nowadays, in most countries, parents have the opportunity to send their children either to single –sex  or coeducational schools, however, it is considered by some that sending children to single –sex school  has drawbacks in the future. In my opinion, I believe that studying in single-sex school does not have any effect on a child’s future. Moreover,  it enhances gender specific skills and builds their confidence  which is essential  later in life.
Firstly, studing particularly in same gender school boosts gender specific skills.These skills are specific to the child’s gender for instance, in girls' schools they are more keen to learn  specific skills such as crafting, drawing, whereas in boys' schools, boys will be more interested in sports, such as swimming, cricket. Theses skills depend on gender specific interests as well as their physical capacities. Moreover, learning these skills in schools specifically for girls and boys will prepare for competition within their own sex. Some children can take these skills as profession later in their lives.
Furthermore, same sex schools' boosts confidence in children. As there  are differences in the physical abilities between boys and girls, so  judging them in competition of physical abilities will always lead boys towards winning, the same can be the case with girls as they mature  faster than boys so their competition in class will lead girls. Thus, they can lose their confidence. Equality is important for confidence as it inculcates fare standards of competition.Hence, single sex- schools can boost their confidence in the long run.  
In conclusion,  single –sex schools does not hinder child’s growth in future,Furthermore enhances their confidences and skills."
"In many countries today, parents are able to choose to send their children to single sex schools or co-educational Schools. Some people think that children going to single sex schools have the disadvantages later in life. To what extent do you agree?","Nowadays parents have the option of sending their children either to single-sex schools or mixed schools. While single-gender schools are thought by some to have a negative impact later in child’s life, I partially disagree with this notion as studying in single-sex schools has some merits as well.

On the one hand, co-educational schools often mirror the real world which lacks in single-gender schools. Studying with opposite gender facilitates communication and understanding among students and they learn team working skills that will be essential in their future career. Moreover, girls and boys have different perspectives about various things and they are never able to understand and respect this difference if they have never studied together. It has also been observed that people who have studied in single-sex schools are less confident while speaking to audience consisting of both genders. Hence, there are certain aspects of life where students, studying with same gender, may suffer.

On the other hand, sending male and female students to separate schools is often due to some religious or cultural beliefs. In teenage, students tend to develop early relationships triggered by hormone changes. Thus, studying with same sex students results in less distraction and indiscipline, leading to effective class time.  Furthermore, girls are often believed to be fast learners. They develop and progress quicker than the male students. Therefore, studying in single-sex schools offer both genders a platform where they can learn at their own pace. Also, there are certain sections of study such as human biology that teachers find difficult to teach in same depth to both genders in the same classroom and this can easily be resolved by resorting to different schools for both genders. Finally, attributed by the effectiveness and quality of classroom sessions, students at single-sex schools often get better exam grades.

In conclusion, I believe that studying in single-sex schools has certain advantages that cannot be overlooked by its disadvantages and parents can be the best critics to decide the appropriate kind of school to send their children for getting education."
"Some people think that the best way to become successful in life is to get a university education, whereas others say this is no longer true. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","Everyone wants to be successful in their life. Few individuals opine that tertiary education is the only key to success, while others denied it. This essay will intend to analyze both the views with my pespective.

There are many reasons why some people believe that success depends on tertiary educations. Firstly, people who want to be settled in their career at 23 years then have only the option of graduation. There are many professions such as Law, Engineer, Doctor in which tertiary education is essential for them. If people who complete their graduation, they will not have problem to get a job. For instance, In Amazon, people which are interested in getting a job then they will have to show atleast university education. As a result, university education is extremely helpful for those who are interested in a field job.

On the other hand, Some masses believe that university education is not decide your success. There are mant reasons behind this notion. In the world, many peoples have their god-gifted skills such as speaking skills, sports skills, music skills or many others by which they are focusing on that particular skill so that achieve success in life. Many things are beneficial to do practical instead of theoretical. For example, In India, 70 percent of people run their own business on a large scale but interestingly, they do not have a tertiary education degree. Hence, success is depends on you and your skills not on others factors.

In conclusion, Although people can achieve success without any degree or education but in my opinion, in the modern era, tertiary education is a more advantageous and better option for individuals."
"Studies show that many criminals have a low level of education. For this reason, people believe that the best way to reduce crime is to educate people in prison so they can get a job when leave prison. Do you agree or disagree?","Researches illustrate that many felons have a low level of education. Therefore, individuals think that the better method to minimize crime is to educate people in jail so they can get a job when leave jail. I totally agree with this statement because putting criminals behind bars can bring many benefits inclduing, deterrence, and rehabilitation offenders. 

To begin with, I completely believe keeping criminals in imprisonment can bring many advantages .  To begin , prison sentence  is the effective way to mitigate the rate of crime in community. This is because prison sentence deter other people to turn for crime, which this can make people think twice before enganging in illegal behaviour. In addition, prison is a better opportunity for the governments to educate offenders about what right and wrong. For example, the government can organize educational campaigns in prison in order to teach criminals moral values. As a result, raising awareness among felons  can make criminals a good citizens when they release .

Furthermore, in prison authority can provide education and vocotional training for criminals.  For instance, the authority in prison can allow criminals to complete their study in university or school, which this can contribute to help criminals to improve themselves. Consequntly, when the offenders releases they will are more likely to get a better job opportunity because they have enough education and skills. 

To sum up, I strongly believe prison sentence is efficient method to alleviate rate of crime in society because it bring many  benefits namely, deter other people to commit crime , and rehabilitation of criminals to become a good citizens and help them to find a better professional life."
Studies show that criminals get a low level of education. Some people believe that the best way to reduce crime is educating people in prison so they can get a job after leaving prison. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Researchers have shown that the tendency of people to commit a crime is the result of lacking education. It is asserted that educating criminals during the time they are imprisoned is the prime solution to reduce the increasing crime rates. While I claim that this method is beneficial to a certain extent, I believe that there are several better ways to tackle the problem.

On the one hand, I admit that educating convicts is a rational option in terms of reducing the number of people getting involved in illegal activities. The primary reason is that education provides prisoners with essential vocational knowledge and training, consequently enabling them to get a job after returning to the community. Those acknowledged skills assist them in earning a living to pay for their living fees and look after themselves as well as their families, preventing them from relapsing into illegal acts, stealing or pickpocketing, for example. Moreover, should prisoners be educated thoroughly, it is feasible that they are aware of their faulty actions and look forward to embarking on their lives again. Therefore, there is a likelihood of recidivism being reduced. 

On the other hand, I contend that the given solution is not comprehensive in today’s society as it only benefits those who have already committed a crime. In addition, bringing criminology into academic programs for the youth is considered more advantageous. To be more specific, the future crime rate can effectively be prevented by imparting the drawbacks of committing a crime to students and admonishing them not to be involved in those illegal acts. Furthermore, besides criminals getting a low level of education, there has been a significant number of white-collar inmates, such as lawyers or businessmen, who pursue tertiary education. Thus, there is no point in providing them with in-prison teaching. Instead, imposing extended and stricter punishments has a long-lasting impact on ensuring that they won’t make the same mistakes and also deterring people from thinking of carrying out a crime. 

In brief, while educating offenders during their time in prison has several advantages, I recommend governors highlight the need of having crime education as a part of academic programs and implementing harsh punishments in an attempt to decrease the number of criminals."
"Studies show that many criminals have a low level of education. For this reason, some people believe that the best way to reduce crime is to educate in prison, so that they can get a job when they leave prison. To what extent do you agree.","Education is the key to success and it helps a person to create his mind for good and bad things. As per the study, it is believed that most of the criminal offences are performed by less educated people. For this reason, I agree with the fact that education is worth giving in prison, so that the prisoner may get a job after the completion of the punishment.

Going deeper, the reason behind the wrongful action is the lack of a healthy mindset. If the person is educated enough  then only he/she can understand what is good or what is bad for themselves. Moreover, a good education can lead to a good lifestyle. Furthermore, giving proper guidance to a prisoner can give an individual strength to deal with the fact that whatever he has done was not right and from now onwards he/she will not do any such offence.

But somehow, this fact cannot be denied that we can see some highly qualified people doing criminal deeds. For instance, the owner of the brand, Kingfisher, caught in money laundering case which is a crime. On the other hand, we have seen many filmstars being involved in drugs and breaking all the rules. All these people were literate. Now let us also discuss less-educated guys. We all must have heard about 'Nirbhaya' case, all the boys involved in the cruelty were not from a good background. They all got death sentence as a punishment but one of them was minor, so he was released from jail after some time. He was given guidance in the jail about how he can be a good person and options of what he can do after his prison is over.

Concluding this, as we can see crime can grow anywhere or in any field, it is also important to focus on positive attitude, good habits, and general behaviour than teaching them books only. Although I am in favour of higher studies in imprisonment, I also support psychological help."
"The best way to solve the world’s environmental problems is to increase the
cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles.To what extent do you agree or disagree?","n recent years, some people believe that the government increasing the cost of fuel for vehicles is the primary way to solve the environmental problems, whilst others hold the reverse viewpoint. I disagree with this statement. In this essay, I will explain my viewpoints in detail in the ensuing paragraphs.

To begin with, the front and centre in this favour are that cars are necessary means of tools for commuters due to inconvenient public transport in a rural area.Moreover, it is undeniable that the exhaust gas emitted by the usage of automobiles causes environmental pollution. However, raising money for fuel does not solve the root of the phenomenon. For instance, people need to pay more for fuel in order to get to a specific location, which does not change the probability of use. This indicate that this policy would not improve much environmental issues.

At the other end of the spectrum, transportation indeed plays a vital role in our daily life. Considering  carbon dioxide emission, it is the leading cause of air pollution. Therefore, the government may divert some budget to build more facilities for public transport. On the other hand, if they provide some discounted ride plans for taking ones, it would be a better way to decrease the chance of the use of private vehicles. The monthly pass is a salient example. Based on such compelling evidence, it appears that government incentives may improve air pollution. 

In summary, the growing use of automobiles is an issue that needs to be addressed. It is widely believed that the promotion of public transportation can solve environmental problems nowadays."
"The best way to solve the world’s environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other private vehicles.


To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In modern days increase in automobiles and ,technology  causes the rise of pollution and toxic air Pollution affects the earth and causes global warming .I agree with the solution the best way solve the earth's environmental issues is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other automobiles. In ,addition an increase in the productivity of Electric vehicles is the best way to stop global warming also some other ways to reduce this problem.

First and foremost  nowadays most people have  cars and own vehicles it is good to hike the prices of petrol and diesel so that people can  use public transport instead of own vehicles.For ,instance if the government increase the  price of fuels so people can use public transport and it leads to a decrease in air pollution in the air.In ,Delhi the government come up with the solution on the  weekend  people can use   only public  transport instead of their own vehicles. So that the usage of vehicle decrease on particular days these results to decrease the air pollution .

In addition the government and the automobile industry is expanding the productivity of Electric vehicles so  that the consumption of gas is decreased .For ,instance if the prices of fuel hike people can look for alternative usage so that if the productivity of EV  increases and the cost may be affordable the public can buy  electric vehicles .It results in an increase in EVs and a decline in fuel vehicles.

In conclusion,the increase in the price of fuels is resulting from the decrease in global warming and however, the government can take some steps to decrease  global warming like planting  trees which lead to a decrease in heat in the environment and therefore they can take C02 and give good air.So that not only increases the fuel some measures have to take to improve the earth's atmosphere."
"Directors of large organizations earn much higher salaries than ordinary employees do. Some people think it is necessary, but others hold that it is unfair. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Almost in all the industries or organizations the pay of directors is much higher than normal employees and they also receive more facilities compare to others, according to some people it is necessary, whereas others think that it is unequal. This disquisition will discuss both the views and I will give my opinion in the conclusion.

To commence with, according to some people, the salaries should be higher of derectors because they run the whole business, directors are the people who take burden of employees other than that they also handle customer relationship, which is most crucial part of any organization. In addition, managers who manage the company and also they have to available 24x7 and also they even forget about their family sometimes and because of these kind of efforts the business gets successful and this can be the reason for their higher payout because managers or directors not just handle the business, but they also manages the employees and get connected with the employees. Additionally, a manager holds a position for a longer time and he or she gains much experience which needed or they tend to change less companies compare to other people. For example, we can see many directors who are in their later stage of life and they are most experienced, and still companies urges them to stay in touch even after retiring just because of their past work for company. Moreover, individuals who are on higher positions often holds higher education or higher degree in that particualar field.

On the other hand, some believe that it is injustice for employees as they are backbone of any company, and play a vital role in company`s success but they cannot handle the loss and much pressure they just have to work on only one department of an organization, whereas a director have to focus on everythig from gains or loss of a business to salaries of employees.

In conclusion, in my opinion, it is fair that managers or directors holds higher salary because they deserve it based on their work, experience and education qualification. And many organization think that it is worthy to increase their salaries as they are important aspect of any company."
"Directors of large organizations earn much higher salaries than ordinary employees do. Some people think it is necessary, but others hold that it is unfair. Discuss both views and give your own opinions.","There has been a contentious topic about whether it is necessary for managers working for large corporations to be paid much higher wages in comparison with normal employees. In this essay I will first analyze both camps before giving my own opinions. 

Some people hold a firm belief that directors should earn a better salaries than lower-level employees. This is due to the huge amount of work that a manager have to take care of. Not only do they have to maintain the work efficiency of themselves, but  also of their employees as well. Consequently, bosses have to put in more effort in comparison with their subordinates. Another factor that should not be ignored is that a lot of big corporations require their candidates to have an outstanding background before applying into the manager position. Therefore, managers would certainly have a huge knowledge and experience on the field that they are working right now; hence, it is fair for them to have a higher salaries than their employees. 

Others stand their ground on the idea that it is unfair for staffs to be paid less than their managers. Their argument is based on the fact that businesses can not operate without their staff; therefore, ordinary staff should be treated the same as their bosses. Big corporations nowadays can have their number of staffs reaching thousands, and the majority of this are normal employees. Therefore, their importance should not be overlooked by employers, and they should be paid equally as their managers. 

It is true that the importance of ordinary employees should not be underestimated. However, I strongly agree that directors should be paid more, thanks to the huge effort that they have to put on their work, as well as the enormous effort that they can provide to their firm."
"As well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. To
what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is urged by some people that companies should have responsibilities for society as with making profits. Although organizations need to get good finance, I believe that companies should consider having a good moral obligation to  society. 

On the one hand, it is clear that the main target of each company in the business area is making money. In other words, organizations can be run for a long time by getting inherently adequate incomes and it makes more local people get job opportunities. For example, if there is a big industry in some regions, the people in this region do not need to migrate to other cities in order to get a job and they can able to get a job in their local factory. Therefore, companies or factory must need to get higher profits to extend the companies for reducing jobless rates and to pay extra incentives to employees. 

However, having a great obligation to society plays  a vital role in the business area for getting both companies ‘reputation and a better environment in our civilization. Most industries should consider how to protect the environment from getting the effects of production and industrial waste that come out from their factories. For instance, as for paper industries, most raw materials come from trees and this can be harmful to the earth we liveon . Therefore,  authorities in factories take into consideration  recycling or upcycling to protect the environment. Moreover, enterprises are able to keep a high profile and improve the reputation of organizations’ names or brands by setting up a charity and donating money to the public who are really in need such as the homeless, orphans and nursing homes. 

To sum up, nevertheless getting a significant amount of money in enterprises is paramount to running a business for a long time, it is also important to have social accountabilities to achieve success in enterprises."
"As well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In the eyes of some, businesses are not only economic units; rather, they should shoulder social responsibilities. I totally agree with this viewpoint as when doing so, businesses are indeed investing in their sustainable development.

In the short term, shouldering social responsibilities, say social and environmental ones, could buy businesses opportunities to gain profits in return. When fulfilling their tax obligations, businesses can improve their financial credit scores. This is because they can prove that their tax records are clean, thereby buying businesses opportunities to approach low-interest loans and raise funds more effectively. Thus, businesses can take this advantage of competitiveness over their rivals and gain more profits. Also, adopting manufacturing practices that minimize environmental damage is financially beneficial for businesses. This strategy enables businesses to avoid huge environmental taxes and protects them from boycotting campaigns of environmental activists.

In the long term, this strategy could bring both sustainable profits and new customers. When taking social responsibilities, say philanthropic activities, means an investment in expanding the future's market. An explanation for this argument is when helping impoverished people escape ingrained poverty and have a higher standard of living, businesses are creating potential customers in the future , and in turn, selling more products to these new generations of customers. Furthermore, this strategy helps businesses draw new customers. In fact, when taking public responsibilities, businesses could establish a picture of themselves as economic units not only generating wealth but also accompanying society in reaching common goals and solving challenges. This helps build trust and bonds between businesses and the community and new customers will come later.

In conclusion, although businesses are economic units generating wealth, they should shoulder social responsibilities because this is a sapient investment in their sustainable development."
"As well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. To
what extent do you agree or disagree?","Social relation is also critical in businesses apart from making revenue. I completely agree with this opinion due to the fact that networking and maintaining relationship with customers is vital to the continued success of any business.

Establishing any business requires capital, and irrespective of the starting amount, many business owners want to make returns. Therefore, creating a network of customers is crucial. That is, an investor needs to market his business to potential customers who will either patronise the business for direct consumption or those who will retail to final consumers. For example, many farmers in Australia either sell directly to consumers or supply their farm products to store outlets for onward selling to final consumers. This is a prove of social responsibilities in business.

Apart from networking, another factor in business is maintaining strong relationships with customers. This factor is crucial in achieving a sustainable business. The primary reason for this is that, there are competitions in businesses, therefore, those investors who can continue to satisfy the aspirations of their customers will likely survive in the competitive market. Otherwise, the business may collapse in the short term if many customers are lost. The sudden growth of Facebook, for instance, has been due to customers' satisfactory feedback. Despite the popular social media being established late after the likes of Yahoo and many others, Facebook has been a platform to reckon with among its counterparts, with millions of users. This is another proof of social responsibility in businesses.

In conclusion, accruing revenue is not the only interest in businesses. Social responsibilities like networking and maintaining relationships with customers are also important if any business will survive for a very long period of time. These are crucial factors that any business owner needs to understand."
"As well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In the modern society, it is encouraged that young people should develop the enterprenership mindset and building up their own enterprises. It is clear to me that the more money the bussiness makes the more responsibilities to the society it should contribute to. 

Firstly, it is absolutely no deny that businesses play a very important role in creating jobs for man. For example, Vinamilk is one of the largest food producers in Vietnam. They currently employ around 10 000 workers throughout Vietnam, according to their annual report. We can imagine that what might be happening if this giant company bankcrupt? Thousands of workers will be potentially loosing their job. This might impact markedly in the social balancing and the social sercurity as unemployment will rise up.

Secondly, large organizations are capable to use their manpower to provide social facilities in a bigger scale. For instance, during the last two years of Covid, Vingroup,in accompanied with Chairman Mr. Vuong and his wife had been donated nearly 9000 billions VND to help our government and Vietnamese people to fight with the coronavirus. This unbelievable distribution help to save many people lives and children. Without this generous co-operation and these individuals, it is hard for our government to do such things fastly and precisely as they was shown to the public in the last period of time.

In conclusion, universal is operated in a circle. As it is written in one of favourite quote that “the more you give out, the more you get back”. The more the bussiness contribute back to people, to the society, to help them to archive the desirable goals, the more successful the bussiness can get as it will be paid back by people who were helped by them. The companions between enterprise and society help to faciliate to create a better world for people to live."
"Nations should spend more money on skills and vocational training for practical work, rather than on university education. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Before this, People often focused on higher education but it is only theory and rarely practice. In my opinion , I suppose that countries should invest more financially on skills and occupation coaching for practical work. To some extent I agree with this statement and I have some reasons below. 

First of all, mostly, university students have to borrow money from the government to study education. This is a lot of  burden and pressure on them. While training school is cheaper, faster and easier looking for jobs. For instance, people who only through about 6 or 8 months to learn about nail medicare, then they can apply for a job immediately. Moreover, Nowadays, nations in the world lack blue-collar workers such as chefs, workers at farms and staff at hotels. Furthermore, those people have an early career without debt, which helps them be happier and helps them save money to set up their families.

But everything has pros and cons.Owning a graduate degree has many benefits such as big companies often choose applicants who are completely done at university . Without a university degree there might rarely be chances of promotion in the future and they might receive a lower rate of salary with the same position than those who had graduated. 

In conclusion, I strongly believe that states in the world should provide more money for vocational teaching to improve and develop it."
"Nations should spend more money on skills and vocational training for practical work, rather than on university education.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is argued by many people that the countries must provide more skilled drill and should spend less on tertiary education. This essay agrees that the more funds should be given for imparting work training as it will create more jobs and people tend to stay in their home country. 

To commence with, it is quite evident that by giving job-specific training, young people will tend to obtain more jobs through these occupational related practices. To illustrate, many students, who cannot afford to pay the university fees, seek the professional instruction after completing their school, and prepare themselves for work. It not only gives them confidence, but ensures economic stability in their lives. Moreover, some children due to lack of jobs move to foreign countries, which lead to brain drain in the countries, as the overwhelming majority of the educated millennial shift to other countries. 

Furthermore, due to the soaring fees for research or higher studies, students’ resort to easy courses which help them not only in securing a job, but also give them financial stability. For instance, in India, the government has started a vocational training program in schools, which promise a secured work to the students.

To conclude, it is clear that the benefits of work-related training programs, outweigh the disadvantages, by providing more employment to the youth, however, merits associated with university education such as research work should not be ignored. Thus, the government should fund the short-term training on the one hand, but also promote higher education for the brighter future of the country."
Advertisements are becoming more and more common in everyday life. Is it a positive or negative development?,"It is rather often that businesses have to endure the cut-throat competition for attracting customers and for increasing sales as well. In order for their products to either stand out from the crowd or to emphasis how unique their products are, companies usually use advertising as a tool attracting customers. In my opinion, marketing and branding strategy for boosting sales by means of advertising new and unique features of a product is mostly negative development.

Most of the brands if not all claim their product to be the most fascinating which suits to the customers’ needs with new features in the market. They do so to create a positive impression to the consumers to increase their sales and profitability while also staying ahead of their competitors. For instance, the advertisements on TV for products like shampoo, soaps or body lotion proclaim their products having the best ingredients and, in addition to that, consist of something new that their counterparts lack of. They may even outdo their old products by adding new flavour or a new vitamin claiming that their new product is the best ever. Obviously, this is a marketing strategy boosting sales and profitability creating a craving between the consumers for their products at the same time.

As the new features which the businesses advertise are nothing novel, it is mostly a negative trend doing so. They are merely a different version of the same product with a change of flavour or ingredients. Some of the car manufacturers and electronic device manufacturers sometimes indeed do extensive research revamping their products and genuinely add new features for their customers. However, most of the time, consumer products or perhaps some of the well-known electronic brands enjoy adding more creativity to their advertisements rather than the real products and hence making the wrong impression on people that they need these new products. 

To conclude, it is through research and development that novelty and innovation of products should be produced and not through tricks of marketing and advertising."
Advertisements are becoming more and more common in our everyday life. Is it a positive or negative development?,"In this day and age, consumers encounter a large number of advertisements on a daily basis. In my opinion, the increased prevalence of advertisements can have both beneficial and detrimental effects.

On the one hand, advertising has many advantages for both businesses and customers. First, it will help businesses to boost their sales. This is mainly because when consumers are informed of the information about a certain product, they may be interested and decide to make a purchase of that product. For instance, Pepsi and Coca-Cola, which are two leading soft drink brands, always have impressive advertising campaigns. Second, for customers, it can be easier for them to make buying choices. When watching or reading advertisements on the internet or in magazines, customers will be aware of new products which they may need. Therefore, they can compare with other similar products and choose the one with the best quality. 

On the other hand, the abundance of advertisements can leave several repercussions for both businesses and customers. To begin with, customers may be bombarded with too much information when they see too many advertisements on social media or TV. These pieces of information can be inaccurate about the products. As a result, customers might buy products that are not necessary or not as satisfactory as shown in the adverts. As for businesses, using too many advertisements can cause a waste of money. Instead, they can use that amount of money to invest in product research and development.

In conclusion, although advertising is important for both businesses and their customers, it can also have adverse impacts."
Advertisements are becoming more and more common in everyday life. Is it a positive or negative development,"There is a controversial phenomenon heating up a debate over the fact that nowadays, people are bombarded with an eclectic mix of advertisements. This essay is devoted to weighing up the pros and cons of the perspective, followed by parallel reasons.

Without a shadow of a doubt, people these days gain a lot of benefits thanks to the commercials. In particular, a great number of newly-launched products are informed to customers through advertisements, which not only help them be aware of the array of selections available to their demands but also create opportunities for the companies to approach prospective customers. For example, many technological entrepreneurs namely Apples, Samsung, Huawei, and Xiaomi have optimized the publicity materials in various ways so that people could know about their company’s latest product, which helps them generates higher profit and become top-ranked technology corporations. Hence, it is undeniable that these commercials have a tremendous impact in this day and age.

While the redeeming features of advertisements are widely acknowledged, its counterpart still lingers. Nowadays, customers are complaining about the real quality of some products is way too different from what they have seen and known from the TV commercials promoting them. For instance, many marketers or sellers can employ some tricks and gimmicks to entice people to buy products that may be of poor quality, leading to great dissatisfaction among purchasers. Therefore, advertising could pose some threats to customers if they can not resist the temptation of products that are advertised way beyond their expectations.

In conclusion, commercials play a paramount role in business development and people’s selection of the product. To my mind, this trend is advantageous as well as detrimental."
"Some people think that in the modern world we are more dependent on each other, while others think that people have become more independent. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","It is argued whether we are more independent or dependent in such a modern world. While it is true that we now cannot live without others’ contributions, I believe that we lead a more independent life than before.

There could be two main reasons for the argument in favour of dependent life. With the development of industry, people mostly focus on a specific field, which means that without others’ efforts the necessity or the entertainment equipment, such as food, clothes and smartphones, cannot be attained. Besides that, the services also prove the connections between the supplier and the consumer. For example, shopping online is a usual consumption habit for most modern people, especially for young adults, it is others that deliver the commodities to the consumers. That is to say, in modern society, living alone seems to be unrealistic.

On the other hand, advanced technologies provide opportunities for citizens to avoid communicating face to face. Activities that had to be completed in person can be finished through the Internet. For instance, more people prefer to buy goods online, since it is more convenient,  redundant and cheaper. In the meanwhile, learning online has become an ordinary way for most students to have access to education. In this way, it is more flexible to absorb knowledge, particularly for the adults who have jobs during the day. When it comes to occupation, independence seems to be more obvious. In some companies, employees are allowed to work from home or elsewhere. The communication between colleagues is reduced, and the contact between the staff and their managers is fewer as well.

In conclusion, although we living rely on others’ efforts to some extent, I believe that we are more independent because of advanced equipment than we were used to ."
Some people think that in the modern world we are more dependent on each other while other think that people have become more independent.discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Modernity has changed the world since the last decades and with it society's have transformed. Therefore people's interactions has became weaker, resulting in more independent persons. Along with this changes in relationship behavior, technology has became stronger causing effects in modernity interrelations. 

Firstly, is important to mention that some decades before families around the world were bigger, making this connection between individuals stronger because families were more band together, sharing same interests, routines, place of living and jobs. Nowadays, families usually have fewer kids and their housing belongs related to their jobs making families apart. According to a Harvard study, since 2000 it was demostrated that families have many members living abroad or in a different city from their parents, therefore this kind of distance develop on people autonomy and independence. 

Additionally, is impossible to avoid that technological growth has parted society's, because this innovation allow connections with people all around the world, consuming the attention that at first was given to a local place and now it is focused globally, making individuals apart because of their interests.

On the other hand, there are some people that disagree with it and support that modernity has delevoped more dependency between persons, claiming that society's have become more globalized, therefore they are more linked between them at economic, political and cultural issues. A clear example is the actual of the performance of economy between countries, in the Colombian case we are dependent from China's economy. Making this country conditional on what happens on the other side of the world. 

Finally, hilghlighting different point of views on the evolution of dependency in relations, I consider that definetly modernity have made people more independent as how it was decades ago. Making families and groups apart, caused at first because of the technology innovations we have had."
"Interview forms the basic selection criteria for most large companies. However, some people think that interview is not a reliable method of choosing whom to employ and there are other better methods. To what extent do you agree?","In the modern world, traditionally, in order to get a job in a good place, people need to go through a series of interviews. This practice is quite universal and many companies use it. Despite everything, this method has a number of disadvantages and advantages. In spite of the advantages, I think a meeting is a good path.

Advocates of the method believe that today at the time, when a huge number of people are fighting for equality and diversity, a universal approach  to recruiting can be the key to a successful business. Another good thing about interviews is HR specialists should not prepare to examine every candidate  separately. It makes the process  of recruiting more simple and faster.  And finally, the third reason why conferences are a fine practice for future employees can make ready and answer some common questions before face-to-face communication and it helps them to be more confident and relaxed during the interview.

There are, however, some disadvantages. Common approaches for recruiting may not take into account the personal qualities of a job applicant. A talented but timid  person may suffer from such an interview where he or she will feel uncomfortable. Another bad thing in the interview is monotony. A lot of men and women say the same things day after day. Either because it is taught in the courses, or because humans  think that it will be better if they say common phrases, however, it often happens that a person goes through a dozen interviews in different companies, but does not find a job.

In my opinion, there are maybe better ways of tackling this problem. For instance, HR specialists can approach recruiting in a more personalized way. Every person is unique and if the company wants to be cool,  modern and successful, then this company should take into account the capabilities of each person working in it. In the end, happy people work much better."
"Interviews from the basic selection criteria for last companies. However, some people think that interview is not reliable method of choosing whom to employ and there are other better methods.
To what extend do you agree or disagree?","Recruiting employees is an essential part of any company. It has been suggested that an interview is not a good process of selecting a new worker when there are better methods available. I strongly disagree with this idea, and in this essay, I will provide some arguments to support my opinion.

Generally speaking, there is a wide range of reasons why people believe that interview is a trustworthy way to recruit an officiary. Firstly, it is the best way to get an idea about the personality and social skills of a worker. If a recruiter does face to face interaction with employees, he will know better about his attitude, communication, and efficiency. A further argument in favour of this idea is that employers will be able to know about the patience of labourers. For example, by asking questions to the interviewee, the interview will know about his traits, such as; ability to handle pressure, confidence, and think out of the box.

However, it must be said that there are two points why people think that other systems are suitable than interviews. Perhaps the strongest of these is that workers can be judged by written tests. If an employee gives the written test, you might be able to learn as regards his theoretical knowledge which is also important for the company. In Addition, group discussion is another better process for electing a man. This is because you will understand them easily whether they are good or not in conversation skills. 

In conclusion, recruiting a better person is a very tough job for the interviewer. However, I feel that the best way to solve this issue is by giving importance to every method. If we judge our newcomers by all processes, we might be able to get our best hand for our company."
"Interviews from the basic selection criteria for most large companies. However, some people think that an interview is not a reliable method of choosing whom to employ and there are other better methods. To what extent do you agree or disagree.","In the contemporary era, every multi-national company recruits its employees by taking face-to-face interviews. Is taking an interview is a convenient method as compared to all other hiring processes? In my perspective, doing so is logically flawed because in terms of better chance to check person’s technicality knowledge and confidence along with his way of speaking.

Primarily, a recruiter can evaluate the IQ level and the knowledge related to his specific field. The reason behind is that by asking the different type of instant questions such as mathematical problems, Logical reasoning question, various situational scenarios, and so on, thereby, to check the problem-solving skills of the applicant. An MNC named Infosys, for instance, hired 100 students from my college by taking multiple rounds of examination.

Besides checking his brain skills, the interviewee’s confidence level can be verified. An employer can ask various personal life questions or can arrange group discussion interviews, which means by making group of 4-5 students in one panel, and give any current topic related to any aspect in the world, which is not possible in any kind of other hiring processes. Consequently, the candidates who speak well, and with confidence can be recruited.

Moreover, the applicant’s manner of speaking can be gauge only in a verbal conversation. This is because many jobs required their employees to talk politely with their international clients and national as well; therefore, talking skills can be only judged by taking interviews. For instance, in a call-centre job, every employee has to deal with a number of customers to solve their queries. In that field form of speaking is a must and it should be decent, clear and loud.

In conclusion, since not only is the better way to check courage and way of communicating of the applicants but also it provides an opportunity to connect with them personally, I am convinced that interviews are the best way to finding any information of the aspirant."
The increase in the production of consumer goods result in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve the problem?,"In modern life, it is irrefutable that the surge in the demand for consumer products has left detrimental effects on the natural environment. However, the central questions here are why such an adverse relationship between the increasing goods consumption and our nature has occurred, and what solutions can be executed to address this issue. The purpose of this essay is to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon and then, propose some possible measures.

To begin with, one of the primary factors resulting in the negative impacts of producing necessities excessively is its manufacturing process, which has significantly contributed to the pollution. In major cases, factories use numerous chemicals and heavy metals during their production. In addition, they also release greenhouse gases into the air and nearby water sources, which considerably harm the neighboring ecosystems, wildlife and human health. The fashion industry is a typical example of water pollution due to its dyeing and finishing of textiles. To mitigate this issue, it is advisable for governments to enforce regulations on the use of harmful chemicals and the release of emissions in goods production, as well as introduce incentive schemes to encourage manufacturers to pursue  green manufacturing practices.

Another main contributor to the natural problems is  waste generation. Currently, most  goods are made of disposal, single-use, or non-recyclable materials, which tend to gradually create waste accumulation in landfills. For instance, plastic used for packaging can persist in the environment for centuries. Therefore, the solution to this issue is for consumers to shift their consumption to recycled material and eco-friendly products. Besides, the effort should also come from the producers' side to change to more sustainable production.

In conclusion, the environmental damages were caused by several problems associated with the manufacture of the daily goods manufacture. For a long-term outcome, it generally necessitates a collaborative effort among  governments, individuals and producers to protect  nature while meeting individuals' demand for basic products."
"The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment.

What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?","Nowadays, the more advanced the technology becomes, the more commodities have been produced due to the augmentation in people's needs. Therefore, it is undeniable that mass manufacturing would end up hurting Mother Nature inevitably. The origin of this situation seems to be derived from two main factors, while some remedies could be suggested for this statement, which will be mentioned here.

first of all, several damages to the environment could be addressed to the irresolvable productions. Moreover, the majority of consumer merchandise has been thrown away by careless citizens in Nature which will remain there for a great deal of time. For instance, plastic goods have been made in various forms and due to their flexible feature, have satisfied their producers and consumers, which is well-known for having traumatic effects on animals and their surroundings. the second factor could be the matter of destroying the waste, meaning that should the government get rid of disposals in the city, they would either burn or bury them. In addition, not only does the expansion of creating stocks put a major burden on the authority but removing the waste could have severe consequences for the environment, such as air pollution, tainted soil and water contamination.

Turning to the possible solution, firstly citizens should be encouraged to assist in rectifying their surroundings. By this, we mean that damages to Nature could be declined to the minimum provided that everyone executes some activities to approach this goal, for example, by gathering their waste and terminating throwing it away on the earth. Secondly, the government could spend time and energy on reinforcing the environment and assisting in maintaining it for the next generations. Furthermore, there have been a couple of activities that would be beneficial for this situation, such as recycling and separating harmful goods or producing eco-friendly merchandise.

To conclude, goods' disposals in Nature and various contaminations caused by burning or removing the waste could be the main causes of the damage. However, the government and the citizens could help to preserve our surroundings by recycling and purchasing eco-friendly goods."
The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"The natural environment is harmed as a result of increased consumer goods manufacturing. The main reason for this is that the products which involve chemical materials are harmful to the environment and a viable solution is to make strict laws to protect the environment. 

First of all, one of the first problems of that the number of people consuming increases year after year, and some of them consume more than they need. In the other words, when people consume more products, they become product more goods. In addition, all manufacturers want to meet the demands of their consumers. As more goods are produced, toxic wastes are released from factories into nature. For example, more single-use products are introduced, most of which are non-biodegradable.  These products can remain as waste for thousands of years,  turning our planet into a huge landfill.

A solution that is some measures should be taken by the government. Manufacturers also  should be encouraged to use eco-friendlier materials. For example, the WWF which is a famous brand in Turkey has recently replaced nylon and polyester clothes with reusable alternatives made of materials like cotton or wool. Thus, the clothes which are produced by WWF can be recycled.  

To conclude, the major problem of damage to the natural environment caused by the excessive consumption of products can be partly alleviated by making laws. Furthermore, it is predictable that the number of factories which use eco-friendly materials will increase over time. . . .  . . .  . . .  ."
The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"In today's modern society,  the development of the manufacturing industry  helps the production of consumer products increase in quality and quantity. However, This can lead to some negative consequences for the natural environment. This essay will  examine some adverse effects of the increase in the production of consumer goods and then offer some measures to improve this situation.

     There are many problems resulting from the fact that  the number of consumer goods production increases. it means that these factories can discharge directly more emissions and wastes into the natural environment. for instance, some factories will through untreated sewage into rivers to save money and get more profits for factories. that is the reason why more and more rivers are polluted nowadays.

      Various measures, nevertheless, can be adopted to tackle the situation that the government should adopt some rule on processed rubish. the authorities can apply a ban on the discharge of untreated sewage and spread propaganda for everyone to know about it.

     in conclusion, many reasons can be given to explain why increasing production of consumer goods and different actions can be taken to mitigate the situation."
"The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment.
What are the causes of this?
What can be done to solve this problem?","In these days, the natural settings are harmed by an excessive production of goods for consumers. As a result, it can lead to extinction of natural sources like water and others. I believe that, this problem  could not be tackled wholly, but by recycling we can avoid them.

 It is obvious that, due to an increasing trends in numbers of population, healthy proportion of countries are concerning about how to heighten the goods. As an outcome, they tend to use natural sources like water for instance. This is because, in every production the role of water is crucial, but they release it back from where it was brought. In the process of cooling or heating the goods water's temperature is changed and when it is released, different temperature can affect to  death of water bodies. As a consequence, majority of fishes that cleans water from garbage will probably die out. Such scenario was witnessed in Italy by experts of ""Saving the environment of globe"" in 2010. According to its findings, water is contaminated and set the record of the World with 75% of garabge in seas, ocean and even in  channels.

 To tackle this issue, there is no need to make special infrastructure to observe abovementioned problem and from this it would not be reduced. The only way is to recycle the goods and garbage to economize the expenditures and electricity. If more reusable goods are created it opens way to follow the path under discussion. Moreover, if water is used in producing processes, it should not become redundant. It could be used in other phases, I think. As a result , more money can be invested into making high-quality goods. In China, mega factories have such strategy because of avoiding financial bankrupts.

 To conclude, environments are damaged from goods which were thrown by consumers and this can cause problematic issues. Although this is the problem which could not tackled if the World's people do not reuse materials."
Children find it difficult to concentrate on or pay attention to their studies in school. What are the reasons? How can we solve this problem?,"Many primary and secondary education students are find it challenging to focus on lectures at their educational institutes. This essays discusses the causes of this development and also suggests ways to resolve them.

Many pupils cannot maintain concentration at schools because some of those may have exisiting medical conditions, while it is also likely their daily routine is inconducive for learning. I was suffering from ADHD, attention deficit hyperactive syndrome, which is known to distract students easily who often complain about their inability to lose focus for prolonged period of time. Hence, I believe that it is possible that such syndrome may be undiagnosed in many disciplines, which could explain their lacking power of concentration. As well as this, habits that are disruptive, such as playing excessive hours on video gaming and spending less time in outdoor active, also contribute to this problem.

However, this challenge can be overcome by increasing awareness. Parents need to be aware any underlying medical conditions so that its repercussions could be averted. Therefore, the government can use public infomercials to educate the parents about any health conditions that could undermine their children' ability to concentrate. As well as this, an information broadcast aimed at enlightening fathers and mothers about the benefits of exercising and supervising children's screen time, , such as watching cartoons and digital games, could mitigate the problem. For example, playing outdoors not only increases dopamine but also increases alertness.

In conclusion, some medical conditions and bad habits are the main causes of children suffering from a"
Children find it difficult to concentrate on or pay attention to their studies in school. What are the reasons? How can we solve this problem?,"No doubt, education needs proper attention and focus however these days a number of school-going students are unable to pay full concentration to their studies due to a lack of interest and feeling bored. In this ,  essay I will briefly explain the reason behind this trend and some possible solutions to overcome  this problem in the upcoming paragraphs.

Commence with the major cause behind this issue is they spend a maximum of hours on their cellphone at night while playing games as a result they feel lazy and sleep during school time  .Needless to say, due to parents' careless attitude towards their offspring lead this problem is rising rapidly nowadays. Secondly, the way of teaching also plays a very significant part in academics if the teacher just explains the textbook part without an example then children definitely feel inactive during study time .Apart from this , an unhealthy diet is the third main reason behind this problem .This is because nowadays teenagers love to eat junk food rather than healthy meals.Thus they face many problems while doing studies like eye pain , head pain and many other disorders. 

Although  these are the main problems which can be tackled by the parents and teacher support. First and foremost , parents have to fix their hours  to use smartphones , so that children can sleep early and complete their naps properly. Hence , they do not feel lazy and sleep in school . In fact , the school management has to Change their teaching ways  in which they involve practical work and add different examples to make children interested, thus students enjoy the way of learning and easily grab a topic knowledge. Additionally, parents should make food at home instead of ordering from outside so that students eat healthy food and stay fit and fine .Therefore , these things help to make the force on the education.

In conclusion, every problem has a particular answer like this if students feel lazy and inactive in school then the way to teach should be changed and parents have to restrict hours of using smartphones."
Children find it difficult to concentrate on or pay attention to their studies in school. What are the reasons? How can we solve this problem?,"It is often argued that more and more children facing difficulties to pay attention to their studies in institutions. In this essay, I will explain why the case is so, and give some possible suggestions to eliminate this problem effectively in the following paragraphs.

To begin with, there are many reasons why students are facing difficulties to concentrate on their studies in classrooms. First and foremost, due to enough sleep and lack of nutrition are the one causes of this problem. To illustrate this, nowadays, students are busy solving their assignments, this is because they got more homework from school, and as a result, they have no sufficient time to sleep. In addition, children are more aware to eat fast-food beverages instead of healthy foods for that reason they fall  sick and do not focus on their studies in institutions. For example, fast food like burgers and rolls are more popular food and liked by billion of children but it affects negatively  their health. Also, due to electronic devices students are spending  more time  watching phones and tablets, which is  another reason for this problem.

On the other hand, there are some solutions to eliminate this problem. Firstly, students should take nap properly, which will be helpful for their studies. For example, it is scientifically proven that for better focus on work and study people should sleep at least 8 hours, which helps to relax their mind and grow effectively. Secondly, children should it more healthy foods like apples and oranges which contain more nutrition. Furthermore, teachers should give the minimum amount of homework to their students, which helps children to free and relax their minds and pay better attention during  class periods.

In conclusion, due to lack of sleep and nutrition along with using more electronic devices children are lacking to concentrate on their studies in the classroom. However, taking more healthy food and a proper nap helps them to focus on their studies in school."
Children find it difficult to pay attention or concentrate on school study what are the reasons? How can we solve this problem?,"Children’s education has always been a matter of great concern for parents. In today’s world, this has grown exponentially, mainly due to the constant changing world. One of the primary reasons for this, relates to a child’s concentration and small attention span. This essay will attempt to dissect this cause and propose some reasonable solutions that could help with mitigating this issue.
Due to a child’s small attention span, conventional ways of teaching are inadequate in keeping their interest. In order to get through to a child, it is important to keep their interest for the duration of the study session or class and ensure they view it as a fun activity. Moreover, most schools find it hard to move away from traditional teaching methods such as dictation, using white boards, etc., especially in some developing countries, and as a result fail to engage their students. 
Furthermore, with massive technological growth in recent years, children are attracted towards their phones, tablets, computers, TV, etc. and provide a major source of distraction for them. Many studies have even linked the use of these devices to the release of endorphins resulting in a further dependency on technology. Combine this with the lack of engagement in classroom and education provider’s resistance to adapting to the changing world results in children having difficulties in paying attention. 
This issue needs to be tackled on two fronts. Firstly, parents need to monitor and limit the use of technology outside of school hours. A structured schedule would be a good start and usage of phones & tablets may even be incorporated into a reward system. Schools should take responsibility for the second front. It is vital for them to coach themselves on changing technology and how it can be utilized for providing quality education to children. For instance, the use of interactive applications, modern teaching methodologies or structuring and creating custom curriculum for each child, based on their learning abilities, interests, etc.
In conclusion, it is important to acknowledge and understand the problem, as well as its root cause, utilize modern solutions and creative thinking that caters for the ever-changing modern world. Parents and teachers need to understand children’s interests and how to keep them engaged, while delivering quality education."
"Some experts believe that when a country is already rich, any additional increase in economic wealth does not make its citizens any more satisfied. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Economic growth is one of the top priorities of every state around the world. However, some experts believe that rich nations with any additional increase in economic wealth are unable to create more satisfaction for their citizens. Personally, I hold a different perspective on this notion.

On the one hand, it is argued that individuals from improved societies may not experience greater pleasure because of the heavy workload. Due to the tasks of expanding the economy, businesses are required to boost their productivity and foster innovative progress, leading to increased working hours. Therefore, people may have less time for leisure activities, causing stress and pressure which are the two main indicators when measuring the happiness index in a certain country. For instance, being the most developed economy in the world, the U.S. has the highest suicide rate globally.

On the other hand, I am of the opinion that growth in the economy is positively associated with happiness for several reasons. Firstly, it is undeniable that citizens from richer countries can have a higher living standard, including better living conditions with modern facilities and more chances to access the top education system and the world-class healthcare system. As a result, the world has witnessed a huge flow of people from underdeveloped and developing regions migrating to developed nations with the hope of a brighter future. Secondly, with a prosperous economy, wealthier countries can have more resources to overcome social issues, such as unemployment, environmental damage and inequality. To illustrate, during the COVID-19 pandemic, while poorer countries were struggling to meet their citizens' basic needs, including food, medicine and accommodation, individuals from richer ones can easily overcome the pandemic with financial support from their governments.

In conclusion, while growth in the economy can lead to a more stressful workload, I firmly assert that this development contributes significantly to an individual's fulfilment thanks to a higher living standard and social issues being addressed. It is advisable that countries should continuously develop their economies to increase the happiness of their residents."
"Some experts believe that when a country is already rich, any additional increase in economic wealth does not make its citizens any more satisfied. 
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In this stage of prosperity, the issue under scrutiny, which divides opinions among classes in society, would be whether additional financial support can catalyze more satisfaction in developed countries. Inevitably, the more influx of cash flow the country has, the more influential and powerful that country becomes. Nevertheless, in my book, the word satisfaction may not be closely linked to wealth.

On the one side of the coin, in terms of overall improvement in management, the fiscal surplus may act as a crucial factor. Had the nation had more disposable income, the local dwellers would have had higher living standards. Not only does an additional budget boost higher investment opportunities but also promotes more favourable outcomes and productivity for the entire nation. In other words, when the country has a colossal amount of capital that is highly flexible, it can make the investment in the field of technology and science which might eventually yield more success and development. Take Japan as a typical epitome, as a result of prudent investment in artificial intelligence, the economic prospect of the Japanese has been flourishing over the years which has dominated the Asian world. Seen in this light, an adequate financial resource is too indispensable to resist.

On the other flip side of the coin, living in a money world which is highly materialistic may have counterproductive effects. First and foremost, when wealthy families have more possession, their demands are likely to soar endlessly. Subsequently, criminal rates may accelerate to reach their vertex and may result in more chaos and social turmoil in society. This may neither provoke satisfaction nor meet those basic needs of the inhabitants, namely safety and peace. According to global statistics, developed regions are highly susceptible to assault and terrorism.

In closing, one may debate that supplementary revenue to the affluent country would appear to be a precursor of living standard alleviation and the question of achieving individual satisfaction still remains unsolved."
"Nowadays more and more people want to get things done instantly (services, information, tasks). Why is this? Do you think this is a positive or negative development?","Currently, a great number of people want to reach their goals rapidly and instantly. From my point of view, this phenomenon is mainly affected by the technology advancement and this statement has both positive and negative aspects which I will discuss in this essay.

On the one hand, due to technological development,people are able to do approximately every type of work or exercise within a few minutes and the impact of smartphones is undeniable. Consequently, the ajority of people are using smartphones or laptops in order to do everyday tasks which phenomenon has made people’s life easier and flexible.  For example, people in the past had to go to the theatre in order to buy tickets, however, nowadays it could be done online and it saves a huge amount of time. Thus, currently,people want to get things done instantly.

Turning to the phenomenon of doing everything instantly, it is obvious that due to the evelopment of the technology people want to reach their goals rapidly. Therefore, in some cases,it is a positive development because people try everything to reach their goals and doing it faster is very beneficial. However, sometimes people can do something rapidly with not analyzing the quality of their work that’s why sometimes things done instantly can have bad effects.

To conclude, if the present generation wants to get everything done instantly, that is because they grew up using  internet technology. While this trend is largely positive, in my opinion, over dependence on anything is bad."

"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree ?","People have different views on change in climate. They believe that it will have a bad effect on a person's life, but some people argue that we need to accept it rather than try to stop. I am not in favour of this opinion, both governments and individuals should work collaboratively to reduce the risks and impacts associated with climate change.

There are various actions that governments and population take in order to prevent climate change. Firstly we should improve and protect sources of green energy and  we are also plant  a wide range of trees this make prevent soil erosion and helps these animals have a clean food source. Secondly. We can try to limit  influences on climate change such as reducing motorbikes, using gasoline, flying less and buying  products which are good for the environment. Furthermore, the public can affect the actions of governments by voting for politicians who propose to tackle climate change, rather than for those who would prefer to ignore it. In order to get at least some progress in climate variation. 

If, instead of taking the above measures, we simply continue to live without paying attention to these climate changes, I believe that it leads only to fatal consequences. 205  Taking an example, I am not optimistic to be tolerated  rising the sea level. Millions of people would be evacuated because of flood, especially, in the country which did not have means of protection in low-lying areas. These community would lose their working and living places and they have to migrate the near cities or other countries. The potential of suffering humanity would be huge and we can undergo outbreakings of famine and illnesses, as well as getting stronger poverty and homelessness.

In conclusion, it is clear to me that we should tackle the issue of climate variation instead of living with it and I do not agree to find a way to live with climate change."

You should write at least 250 words.","The looming threat of climate change and its effect on our planet and our ways of life is a recognized topic in the modern world. Experts have different perspectives regarding how to cope with this issue. Some state that it should be mitigated even at great costs, others believe that humans should be flexible enough to accept it and change their methods of living. I agree with the former point of view and I think climate change can be considered as one of the hardest challenges of our existence as a specie. In this essay, I will try to illustrate my reasons and draw a conclusion based on them.

On the one hand, it is short-sighted to assume that climate change is only going to affect human beings. For instance, the rising temperatures have decreased the number of glaciers and ice caps at the north pole, destroying the habitats of numerous animals such as polar bears to the extent that most of them are now considered highly threatened. Therefore, since we are solely responsible for this phenomenon, we should take action to stop it and simply altering our life will be cruel to countless other living being on this blue pale dot.

Moreover, the changes that climate change will bring to the geopolitical situation have the potential to lead to wars, famines, and other humanitarian disasters. For example, one of the most agreed-upon consequences of a developed greenhouse climate regime is the change in the patterns of rainfalls to more extreme conditions. Certain areas will start to experience much more rainfall, while others will undergo decades of dry spells. Consequently, governments might go to war in order to gather the required resources of their states. I believe this is a catastrophe for a specie that has flourished on this planet for aeons. 

To summarize, climate change not only affects us in various ways such as wars and famines, but also endangers the life of other living creatures. Thus, accepting the unforeseeable circumstances of a planet with higher temperatures while it can be avoided does not appear to be an acceptable path. I think that preventing climate change should be a top priority for any governmental body and new rules must be legislated to curb this issue."
"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Issues about climate change is a popular topic in debates of scientists, environmentalists or even of ordinary people. I strongly disagree with the idea that we have to search for methods in order to adapt to climate change, I believe that averting climate change provides numerous benefits in the long run, such as economic development and improvements of public health.

Actions should be taken in order to avoid the devastating effects of climate change which in turn contributes to a country’s economic development. For example, most countries nowadays use renewable or clean energy by replacing fossils as a main source of energy in manufacturing industries and in communities as well. This renewable energy does not only stop the devastating effects of climate change but also this new emerging sector opens up opportunity for employment and more investment. Thus, in return this innovation aids in economic development of a nation.

In addition, improvements of public health is apparent once action to cease climate change takes place. Utilizing renewable energy results to less toxic chemicals which makes a cleaner air and improved water quality. This significantly reduce rates of illness and may decrease hospitalization of individuals with existing health conditions such as asthma or obstructive pulmonary diseases. For that reason, it will strengthen the health of each individuals and will narrow mortally rate as public health is way better than it used to be.

In conclusion, humans deserve a pleasant place to live thus, to put a stop on climate change is more beneficial in many ways than exploring methods in order to consider living with it."
"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own or experience.","Some people believe that we could live in an unpredictable environment which resulted from a global warming, whereas others argue that we should find a way to prevent climate change. I totally agree with the later statement. In this essay, I will give reasons to support my opinion, including examples from my experience.

Firstly, not only humans but also animals cannot survive in a harsh environment. Therefore, I think finding a way to live with it is wasting our time. In contrast, we should encourage communities to prevent climate change. For example, due to the global warming, the weather is getting hotter. Consequently, some people in Africa are suffering from it, and some of them died because they could not bare the weather. Another good example is that one cannot live without animals and plants. If the ecosystem of plants destroyed, it will definitely affect animals. Unfortunately, mankind will get the negative impact as well.

Secondly, even if protecting environment requires huge efforts from communities globally, it will lead to a powerful impact and a last longer solution. For instance, dwellers in Australia are confronting with bushfires every year. Australian alone could not prevent this problem, as the global warming need cooporate from everyone. In addition, rising of the weather one degree Celsius may cause some animals extinctions. Nevertheless, societies could stop this issue by pay more attention to adjust the way of living now, such as stop using plastic bags, reducing gas, etc.

In conclusion, people should immediately start prevent the climate change from today, since it will be getting worst in the future. Besides, I firmly agree that people should stop doing harmful things to the nature because this is the only way that we can live longer."
"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Nowadays, due to the increase of reasonable concerns in society about global warming, different opinions emerged and some suggest that, rather than prevention, it is better to adjust to living with climate imbalance. In my opinion it is completely wrong, due to its slaughtering effect on inhabitant's life even with minor changes .

First of all, the arguement of finding a way to live with climate change, could only be claimed by those, who could not understand the destructive impacts of small changes in globe's temperature . As many experts claimed, after the water level surge, so many cities would expected to be swallowed by oceans. Although some people could not acknowledge this matter, all living creatures are collectively under risk . Since the ice masses started to melt long while ago, this era seem to be so late for tiny resolutions. The bigger damaging factors, such as overuse of fossil fuels and waste methods other than recycling should have been adressed so long ago by the governments.

Considering the probable and close effects of the climate change, the only matter mankind may get used to is the new lifestyle, which is more friendly to the balance of atmosphere. This meaures can be exemplified by sun pannels and wind turbines for producing energy and developping sustainable recycling methods for wastes. Although there are some efforts for returning this destruction, obviously it is not enough. More powerful restrictions on humankind's dangerous actions, should be implemented on war footing, in order to saving our kind and other inhabitants of the whole world.

In conclusion, the climate change is an upcoming disaster unless mankind would not adress the issue effectively. Therefore, everyone should adjust to the measures instead of facing the irreversible effects of destroyed climate balance ."
"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","One of today’s major challenges faced by human beings is that a series of problems led by climate change have been more and more severe. Some people suggested that we should try to adapt ourselves to the changes in global climate rather than avoiding the changes. I think that overall, I disagree with the view.

The best way to deal with climate change should be that we actively take every measure to prevent the crisis mainly because If we simply try to live with climate change, I believe that the consequences will be disastrous. To give just one example, I am not optimistic that we would be able to cope with even a small rise in sea levels. Millions of people would be displaced by flooding, particularly in countries that do not have the means to safeguard low-lying areas. These people would lose their homes and their jobs, and they would be forced to migrate to nearby cities or perhaps to other countries. The potential for human suffering would be huge, and it is likely that we would see outbreaks of disease and famine, as well as increased homelessness and poverty.

In addition, considering the variety of measures that our governments and ourselves could take to prevent, or at least mitigate, climate change, it seems unwise that we choose to do nothing. Governments can make and enforce laws that force relevant industries to save on energy and reduce carbon dioxide emissions, which will relieve global warming. They could also impose “green taxes” on drivers, airline companies and other polluters, and increase the investment in renewable energy production from solar, wind or geothermal power. For individuals, we should proactively adjust our lifestyle according to environmental standards. If an increasing number of people are willing to cycle, walk or take public transports to work or school, less automobile exhaust will be discharged and therefore climatic change may be relieved to some degree.

To summarize, it is obvious that we must make the best use of all reasonable methods to address the problem of climate change as possible as we can."
"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change,
we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you
agree or disagree?","Climate change has started threatening our existence on this planet. The rises in temperatures have already caused extinction to many species. Although certain people think that we need to get habitual to climate change, I believe that we should tackle with this issue to lessen our impact on earth’s climate.

There are various steps that government and a person can take to prevent or at least mitigate climate change. Since the days of industrialization we have been consuming natural resources without looking at its consequences. While burning fossil fuels harmful gases which trap heat in our atmosphere are released. Government could pass law on industrial pollution which is making major contribution to greenhouse effect. Similarly, corporate business should adopt sustainable working practices. For instance, switching to environmentally friendly ways of manufacturing using renewable energy such as solar panel. Over past few decades the number of vehicles on road has been increased. As individuals we should use public transport more. In addition to this Government could impose green taxes on private vehicles and airlines. 

If instead of taking the above measures we simply try to live with climate change, I believe that the consequences will be disastrous. Due to Global warming the polar ice is melting causing sea level to increase. If sea level continues to rise it will soon arrives at the point where coastal cities will get submerged into the water. Millions of people would get displaced due to flooding. They would loose their home and jobs. The potential for human suffering would be huge, and it is likely that we would see outbreaks of disease and famine, as well as increased homelessness and poverty.

To conclude, there are several ways to prevent climate change and hence the argument that should find a way to live does not hold water. It merely shows our unwillingness to reduce our carbon footprint."
"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In this modern world, it is argued by some politicians and authorities that climate change has been occurring for many years that is the reason why the governments should provide a solution to live in a way rather than some precautions. I partially agree with that statement and I believe that while people adapt to living with climate change and global warming, countries have to show their effort as much as possible to decrease the increasing trend of temperature.
First of all, since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, hazardous gases and wastewaters have been released by factories to nature. Moreover, it firstly has been caused global warming, then climate change. This harmful situation affected not only human beings but also all the species around the world. To save wildlife and diversity of species, governments should publish a law to ensure the nature will be protected. For instance, if biodiversity changes, all the food production and people’s nutritional behaviour will change too. Furthermore, oceans and inner sea's temperature have increased by years. For instance, while a person who lives in Greenland was not able to swim in the 1970s due to icebergs, now Greenland has become a tourist destination with its beaches. How do not people protest climate changes after witnessing that undesirable situation?
On the other hand, whereas governments and individuals have been showing their effort to save the environment, it is clearly seen that the average temperature of the world has been increasing constantly. Additionally, almost all countries spend a huge amount of money every year in order to protect nature. In contrast, if they invest in the health care system, infrastructures of big cities and most importantly, innovation of agriculture, it would be more beneficial not only for governments financially but also for citizens. Furthermore, as per an academic article published by the World Bank says that whereas the total budget of the countries which fight to prevent climate changes is 450 Billion USD, the effect of the human factor is only 5% to prevent increasing heat.
In conclusion, in the light of information given above, climate change is an undeniable fact. Every human being will face this critical issue. Personally, I think that the governments and individuals should not stop their efforts, but at the same time, peoples have to be aware that this problem will never be fixed and that is the reason why everyone has to find a way to live with this reality."
"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Climate Change is becoming an ultimately heated topic among nations. While it is believed by some people that preventing such a threat to the environment is essential, others think we should just adapt to it.This essay will argue why it's totally preposterous to think that our environment could survive global warming or other climate related disasters without doing anything to prevent that.
Despite the major risks, it is believed that controlling the earth's temperature is beyond our power. Because it is connected to many other factors none of which can be stopped or even predicted. For instance, ocean levels are rising when volcanic eruptions occur which makes the temperature of the water much more higher. Therefore, climate change is not necessarily something we can always prevent.
In contrast, scientists and environmental experts endeavor new approaches to face the fact that the universe is much more heated than ever. They believe so because many attempts have been tried already with great success. For example, Japan performs experimental trials each year and tests the effects of such experiments on the environment.It is for these reasons, it would be logical to think a lot can be done to protect the environment from the rising heat.
In conclusion, it sounds really easier to just find a way to deal with the detrimental effects of the heated atmosphere instead of preventing them. This essay argued why this is extremely inaccurate. In my opinion, ignoring the problem without trying to solve it is totally unacceptable and only makes it worse."
"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Nowadays, because of numerous human activities and overpopulation, the environment is on the verge of being destroyed. In the opinion of experts from both developed and developing countries, instead of finding a solution to rectify the drastic climate change, we should deem new methods of living with this substantial condition. According to my verdict, the idea of not untangling the extreme climatic change is completely preposterous, but for short term trying to accommodate is not entirely wrong.
Firstly, unraveling the climate condition caused abundant money and handful of resources, which could be unendurable for developing countries. Moreover, rectifying the environmental issues that caused climate change could be very time-consuming and hectic. Although human survival is directly dependent on climate condition, various life threatening issues are also existed which demand hotfoot solution. For example, the contagious and life threatening disease corona virus needs more attention to make the vaccine and be curable. Because of this disease the death rate is 56%, and it is very alarmingly  high than death rate due to climate changes.
Verily, there are other serious issues that need urgent solution, but the idea of not taking measures to control climate hazards is completely outrageous. Extreme climate change not only dangerous for human survival, but also for animals and other natural habitat. For instance, the Forest fires in Australia and many other regions which disturb the natural ecosystem of many animals, are the result of extreme climate changes. Legislation and serious measures should be done by government to prevent and rectify drastic climate changes. Furthermore, climate problem leads to many severe problems like water depletion, shortage of natural resources, and environmental pollution.
To conclude, the idea of not preventing extreme climate problems is wholly ridiculous."
"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a  way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In recent decades, global warming has been receiving a great deal of media attention  around the world. Although the idea of co-existence with climate change appears  pausible, people should find out some feasible solutions to combat climate change instead of accepting it in the long run.  There are a number of reasons explaining for the co-existence with global warming.  First, since it is believed that natural disasters are unavoidable, trying to resist them is  hopeless. For example, Japan is particularly susceptible to earthquakes ,or some Asian  countries get hit the most by typhoons due to their geographical location, thus combating  global warming is in vain. Second, the expense of space projects is extremely high ,which  discourages people from investing it to prevent climate changes. In fact, some people  suggest that government funding should be diverted toward improving the living standard  of ordinary people in lieu of investing in space projects, which means they accept to live  with global warming.  However, it’s human’s duty to find out practical approaches to prevent climate  changes because of it negative impacts. First, climate changes is largely shaped by  human’s activities rather than the nature itself. If people don’s take responsibility for  what they have been doing to environment, natural disasters will get closer to them,  causing a big loss on human life such as global warming or frequent typhoons,... Second,  natural disasters occurring in a long run will wipe out biologic diversity including human  being. Therefore, people need to act now to stop global warming.  In conclusion, people should find out other practical approaches to prevent climate change. By considering all substantial effects of climate change on human life, everybody  will find out the ways as well as be highly aware of protecting environment."
"Money should be spent on creating new public buildings such as museums or town halls rather than renovating the existing ones. 
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","I mostly disagree with the question statement as I believe that the government should revamp the current public structures like the museums or town halls instead of building new ones. Although, the common perception of people is that with the growing population and an increase in educational and technological advancement, new public buildings should be constructed, I, however think that the cons of this outweigh the pros.
      First and foremost, I anticipate that the construction of the new public buildings would be a sheer waste of taxpayer’s money. It would cost a hefty amount to build a structure, buy a new land and place, new artefacts and historical things in it. Instead of this, far less amount of money could be used to renovate an existing building by installing new technology in it, placing new artefacts, beautifying it and making it a tourist attraction. This would eventually help generate profits for the government and would also help the local community.
      In addition to the previous point, I firmly believe that revamping an existing building, for example a science museum, would give visitors a chance to both experience the old artefacts and old technology as well as the new developments in this field. Similarly, it would provide the viewers a different opportunity to compare the previous and latest technology. It would further help historians develop a contrast and analyse how much has changed over the course of time.
      Concluding the discussion, I would suggest that the taxpayer’s money should be put to other good uses instead of spending a large chunk of it on establishing new public buildings."
"Some people think the money spent on developing technology for space exploration is not justified. However, there are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","For the time being, that the government’s coffer splurges on exploring space has never failed to provoke controversial debates among people. Some claim that space exploration the money goes into is not reliable while the administrations can splurge their funds in other fields. I would contend that while this thinking is valid to some certain extent, the governors should invest harmoniously in space exploration and other aspects to bring a better life for people.

Without a shadow of a doubt, allocating finance in researching the space should be taken into keener consideration because of some tremendous benefits it brings. Due to a population boom, people have an ever-increasing demand for accommodation to live while the source of land has a strict limit. Finding out other spaces to handle this dire issue is of importance for the governors to expand the size of living area. For example, the recent report of some scientists searching for a homogenous planet with the same living conditions as the Earth's, namely Mars, has lightened the hopes of us in a new destination. Hence, it is undeniable that uncovering the mystery of space is a worthy aspect for the government to spend money on.

While some redeeming features of focusing financially on the space industry are widely acknowledged, there are still other fields for the government to prioritize their coffers such as the healthcare system. Due to its backbone position in the nation’s prosperity and its low-standard facilities, the government needs to splurge money on providing more top-notch amenities and researching for new medicines to revamp the physical health of citizens. This not only creates a robust generation to serve as a labor workforce for the country but also diminishes the high toll of death in current society. For example, Vietnam in the past few years has invested in the medical system by buying vaccines and operating machines to assist the whole nation fight against the COVID19 pandemic. Undisputedly, the governors should contribute their financial abilities to the health development.

To sum up, although space exploration has brought various positive merits, other aspects such as the medical industry still play an imperative role in making the country better. Because of that, the government should equally divide their money into all fields to take the most of their efficiencies."
"Some people believe that they should be able to keep all the money they earn, and should not have to pay tax to the state.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is argued that governments will not collect any tax from individuals so that they can keep all the savings they earn. This essay disagrees with that statement and will first discuss on how the officials spends the levy they gathered and then talk about how the collection help in the economy of the state.

The government does not have enough funds in sustaining the needs of the people. That's why they need to collect the money so there will be a fair distribution for the needs of the country. In the United States of America, which have the most collected compensation of about $23 billion dollars, part of their collection goes to homeless people who cannot afford to provide the basic necessities in life which includes shelter, clothes, foods and medicines. Another division of it, is intended to be reserved in case when there are calamities will happen. 

Another point to consider is the money that the administration gather. It will give an impact to the economy of the country. Through the money that has been collected, it will give rise to more infrastructure and buildings that can open to a lot of jobs not only for individuals living in that state, but also for the people outside their territory. In Australia a lot of work open for non immigrant people. With this thing, the economy of Australia goes up from number 9 to 4.

In conclusion, people need to pay with taxes  for the proper reimbursement of the wealth of the nation."
"Consumers are faced with increasing numbers of advertisements from competing companies.
To what extent do you think consumers are influenced by advertisements?
What measures can be taken to protect them?","In recent years, there are more and more businesses which make an abundance of advertisements to compete with their counterparts. I believe this kind of situation has contributed to some detrimental impacts on customers. This essay is going to introduce some solutions to affix this problem.   

For one thing, the increasing number of advertisements certainly make people feel annoyed when they are watching their favourite TV program, every time the culmination is about to come, advertisements will pop out and interrupt the TV program. For another thing, some advertisements will not provide people with correct information, so they will be misled and waste money buying something that does not live up to their expectations. For the last thing, the worst situation is that some ill-intentioned businesses will use advertisements to scam others and make them fall into a financial predicament.

In order to deal with this problem, the government should introduce some legislation against it. For example, the government can ask all companies to reveal all the information about the products transparently, so that customers will not be cheated. In addition, people should cultivate the ability of media literacy to help them distinguish some exaggerated and misleading advertisements. Therefore, if companies violate the regulations and keep offering advertisements which will confuse customers, people can protect themselves and boycott the products made by them. 

In conclusion, as far as I am concerned, although advertisements cause some inimical effects on people's lives, we still can prevent some negative influences from happening and make the world a better place."
Consumers are faced with increasing numbers of advertisements from competing companies. To what extent do you think consumers are influenced by advertisements? What measures can be taken to protect them?,"These days, the competition between different companies is more and more increasing. As a result, a number of advertisements are launched aiming to attract more people. This essay will discuss how advertisements influence consumers and how we tackle these challenges.

Consumers are influenced by advertisements in several ways. First of all, advertisements raise awareness of their products. To explain, they try to embed a brand image in our brain by using pictures, colours and music. If we can recognize their products, we will have a tendency to choosing these products over other brands. According to recent research conducted by Harvard University revealed that 80 per cent of people make a buying decision easily if they have seen that product before. Furthermore, many companies hire celebrities to promote their commodities. It can encourage people, especially fan clubs, to buy these goods unconsciously. A good example is K-pop stars. Many teenagers in my country buy a product  just because their favourite idols are a presenter even they do not need it. 

There are various ways to solve this problem, firstly, we have to carefully consider whether we need this product or not. It can waste our money if we do not really use it. Moreover, governments should implement some regulations to prevent exaggerate advertisements. This might lead people to misunderstand  product usage, particularly in food and medical products. 

To sum up, companies employ a variety of strategies to reinforce people remembering and buying their products. However, consumers should think precisely before they buy something. Also, governments should play an important role to reduce overstated products as well."
"Consumers are faced with increasing number of advertisements from competing companies.

what measure can be  taken to protect them.","It is universal fact that, advertisement is key part of modern business and is a form of modern art. Yes, it is true that now a days there are plenty of companies which are making same product advertise for their product. Due to this reason, there are number of advertise for one product from various competing companies. To large extent, I believe that consumers are  influenced by advertisement. The impact of advertisement and suggestion to protect consumer is written in father paragraph of essay.
There is both side of impact of advertisement on consumer , positive as well as negative. To initiate with positive impact, because of advertisement people are aware about various type of products and the features. To cite an example, if there is new mobile phone is launching,  then by advertisment consumers comes to know about that mobiles and their features. Beside this, there is negative impact also , children are majorly influenced by advertisement and put pressure on parents to buy product which is shown in the advertisement.
Now moving onto suggestion to protect customers from manipulate, government should banned advertisements of product which has risk of health. Furthermore, if there is risk of health by using product so, there should be label on the product about this. Additionally , government should make Censor Board which decides rather give permission for advertisement or should be banned.
Thus, to conclude that, finally it can be said that , consumers influenced by advertisements but by spreading awareness the consumers and not manipulate from companies."
"Consumers are faced with increasing numbers of advertisements from
competing companies.
To what extent do you think are consumers influenced by advertisement ? What
measures can be taken to protect them ?","It is observed that customes are challenged with elevating expenditure of commercials from enhancing companies. There areseveral reasons behind the issue; However, certain steps can be taken to curb this isssue. Both the causes as well as remedies are discussed in ensuing paragraph.

Discussing the reasons behind number of advertisement issue, the foremost one is that buyers confuse about buying a particular product. To validate, By seeing a pletora of choices to select any one it makes difficult to them. Besides it, consumers feel distracting while working on internet. For instance, someone working on google chrome and one pop-up message came to the pag of worker laptop and this adverstisement attracts to the employee, at the end it affect to his work. Furthermore, it assists children to buy unhealthy food such as paket adibles, junk foods and manchurian.

However, certain step can be taken into consideration on individualistic basis. The most impactul solution is that never provide a personal information such as email address, contact number and address. to elaborate, companies will not able to contact with product buyers. Another beneficial remedy is that block the certain website as they cannot distract customs while they are working their important work.

To conclude, it can be finally analyzed that increasing number of advertisement have bad influences to th buyers as they feel confusing and distracting by it.Henceforth, I believe this debate must be considered on serious note."
"Some people say that the government is responsible for aged care and financial support for the 
   elderly; others argue that it’s the role of individuals.
   Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","At the present, it is noticeable that the older generation are being provided pension by the government. While some residents concur with this strategy, others believe it is the matter of each person and they should be able to please their own needs. Personally, I agree with the country’s supervisors caring and financially supporting the elderly. This essay will examine both views.  

To begin with, the older people are under risk of being thrown away or forgotten by their relatives, which would have caused a lot of concern if the government had acted otherwise. Usually, citizens tend to think that all parents have kids or relatives who could somehow help during tremendously difficult phases. In addition, if the authorities did not support them financially, it would seem as they have absorbed all the human resources just to toss after there is no left. It apparently opposes the liberal view of the politicians.  

On the contrary, the money in the equity of the country should be used more wisely. For example, in the developed country Germany, the older generation takes up the majority of the population, because of the regression in the number of children born. People often can afford what they want, thus the money should be utilized for projects pondering about the enlargement of the population. The elderly can live fully without worries, besides, almost all citizens assist their parents in aged care.  

To sum up, even if the officials didn’t consider the financial help for its citizens in the developed countries, it would be more difficult to the elder citizens in poor countries since every possible thing could happen. Thus, allowing monthly welfare in every country will probably be the best decision, since the older people should also be cared."
Some people believe that the government should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Other say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Certain individuals declare that granting the economic assistance and caring of the old population to be catered by the state, while others object this notion, saying that it is the responsibility of the person to preserve the money for their retirement during the youth. My personal perspective is although it is a burden, the authority should fund the elderly crowd because the state has an obligation to do so.
To begin with, arranging the financial assistance and looking after the whole elderly community is an extremely difficult task for the government. This is because, the ruling authorities have a plethora of other domains  such as health, education to  develop, and deploying a large sum for funding the elderly can compromise other sectors. For an instance, recently, Sri Lanka restricted the large annual budget, which was devoted  to granting living allowances the elderly, and diverted this budget to the sector of education to be more benefited and productive. However, I disagree with this notion because disregarding the older population is ethically incorrect.
On the other hand, implementing strategies to comfort the life of old people is an obligation of the government. In fact,  these people productively contributed to the nation during their youth through involving the workforce, and neglecting them in their old age is morally unacceptable. Hence, the country should facilitate their life during the old age. For an example, recently in India, people have protested against the ruling party and compelled to give a pension to all retired individuals because they have served and contributed to the country during their youth. Therefore, I agree with this school of thoughts because the state is responsible for the every category of people in the community.
In conclusion, national policies should be established to care and fund the elderly population. This is because, the nation has a strong accountability to safeguard these people, who work for the country, despite the fact that devoting a large budget for the elderly is a great hardship for the ruling party."
Some people believe that the government should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement. What is your opinion? Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your own experience.,"It is true that when people advance in their golden years, they require more help and attention. For that reason, a significant number of people hold the opinion that the government should provide financial assistance to the elderly. However, I tend to agree with those who argue that workers should be saving a portion of their income to have a nest egg in their retirement.

To begin with, a culture of saving rather than depending on the government may foster the overall economic development of a country. In other words, if people were to accumulate their own savings for their pension age, it would lessen the financial burden on the government. As a result, the government would be able to release more funds to productive purposes, such as development of infrastructure, industries, hospitals, and so on, which may expedite the overall progression of a country.

In addition to economic factors, putting money aside has some personal benefits. Since savings-oriented people are not dependent on the state for their living expenses, this may instill a sense of self-respect and pride in them. On the other hand, those who are reliant on financial assistance very often face the negative societal stigma, as many people consider them to be inferior and unworthy members of society. Hence, to live a life with dignity and pride, taking responsibility for funding one’s own retirement is evidently a better option from an individual perspective.

In contrast, the provision of monetary outlays for retirees has proven unfeasible in many countries. Since in many nations the number of senior citizens is on the rise, in the long run governments are likely to struggle to sustain the cost of providing for the elderly. The early signs of this have been seen in many countries that were forced to raise the retirement age. Therefore, in the foreseeable future, these kinds of support may become completely unsustainable.

In conclusion, the provision of state monetary support may undoubtedly lessen the concern of retirees to some extent. However, considering the issue of sustainability of this provision, it is better to opt for individual savings from the very beginning of working life, for the benefit of both individual and national development."
"Some people believe that the goverment sholud take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their retirement.
What is your opinion? Is it a postive or negative development?","In this fast changing world era, every age-group need certain facilities for their survival. Although half the population believes that people should get government support after retirement,on the contrary, feels that they want everyone to save money for their future while they are working.I will shine on both sides. In my opinion, taking care of old people is important for society and government.


To accompany, there are many reasons why some people consider against providing facilities such as financial help to retirees. First, the government can introduce more development projects that help improve the economy and development of the country rather than giving people beneficial services after retirement. For example, the latest studies prove that many nations ban facilities after retirement and focus more on developing valuable public projects. In addition, it is seen that sometimes relatives or others cheat on retired people to get money for their service. This is why some people may not get these benefits


On the contrary, nowadays, due to more competition in every field, survival has become relatively difficult. First and foremost, after a certain age, people lose their physical strength and are unable to do labor work such as working as a laborer in factories and drivers etc. Therefore, in this situation they need financial support for basic needs of home, shoes, clothes and food etc.Additionally, in today's world, there are some sons and daughters who leave their parents alone, the government needs to build more old age homes where they get proper basic needs and care. Even the rapidly increasing cost of living and food items adversely affects older people who do not have sufficient savings.


To demolish the whole notion, I gather that retired people contributed their lives for the development of society. Therefore, after retirement, it is the duty of society and government to take care of these people and ensure their better survival."
Some people believe that the government should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement. What is your opinion? Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your own experience.,"The ageing population has led to increasing concerns about pensions and their future sustainability. There are conflicting views on whether the government or the private sector should be responsible for old people during their retirement. Although private pension is becoming popular, my view is that it is the government’s responsibility to provide financial stability to its senior citizens in retirement. 

To begin with state pension programs will help alleviate poverty for older citizens after retirement. For example, in Mexico, studies showed that 55% of its workforce benefited from state pension programs and while those in non-contributory programs alleviated poverty by 20%. These programs are usually tied to employment, so that workers will receive financial and health care benefits when they get old and stop working. In some countries, the state pension plans also include non-contributory programs which benefit those workers whose employers were not compliant with superannuation systems as well as for those individuals that never worked by reason of disability, incapacity or possibly no proper education. 

Further superannuation schemes provide social security for older people in the later years. Such schemes (often mandatory) encourage long term savings. There is also recognition that adults during their workforce years do not provide for their senior years because of current consumption over savings and insufficient saving for retirement when the person is younger. With government retirement programs, there is a redistribution of income within a person's lifetime to enable accumulation of wealth. This is illustrated when a 20year old may not even consider pension contributions upon entering the workforce and focus more on household expenditure or mortgage repayments. 

In conclusion, government funded pensions benefit older citizens through poverty alleviation and social security which I think should only be institutionalised through the state and not burdened on individuals in the private sector."
"money offered for postgraduate research is limited; as a consequence, some people argue that financial support from the government should only be provided for scientific research rather than research for less useful subjects. do you agree or disagree?","It is commonly believed by many people that scientific research is much more important than others research and money should be only divided for scientific research. I firmly disagree with this opinion and I think that money should be apportioned for both scientific research and others research. In the following paragraphs, I shall put forth my arguments to support my views. 

 

First of all, I believe that scientific research is quite significant, but it is never everything in today’s modern world. Even if scientific research leads in the development of technology and science, postgraduate research plays a very important role for individual skills. Furthermore, it may help to become distant from the era of consumption. Take people who are researchers in any country as an example; if postgraduate research is supported by governments, scientific activities may easily be maintained and researchers could gain academic and educational qualification for their future career. 

 

On the other hand, there is no doubt that supporting postgraduate research may end in some new work opportunities. In other words, this research could soften the side effects of unemployment, which result in dramatically decreasing the level of unemployment. Moreover, the income level of the society can increase in particular. Thus, money offered by the government for postgraduate scientific research is necessary to improve the quality of life. 

 

In conclusion, I strongly believe that the budget of the government should also be divided for postgraduate scientific research because this investment contributed to both technological advance and new job opportunities."
Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements and this sets a bad example to young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"It is an obvious fact that celebrities are better known as their luxurious lifestyles instead of their performance in life which provides negative consequences for youth. I have balance opinion for this argument to the following reasons.

On the one hand, many of the people reach to their position by working for it beside their accomplishments , acting skills andperformances,so thats why they become a positive role model for young children.In other words, there are many self-made super stars in show businesses whose talents should be considered.A good example is Angelina jolie, a handsome actor that is distinguished all over the world for her several missions around the world in refugees camps and war zones and helping the no-place people. Eventually, these famous artists behaviour and attitude always have an desirable influence on teenagers. 

On the other hand, there are other celebrities who achieved by other not their own attempts such as inherited money from their parents , married with a rich person , or from being scandalous. For instance, Kim Kardashians whose querrals , untruth relationships and parties are not healthy behaviors that children should learn. These people are impressed the children that  ways to be wealthy in life is such wrong values . Finally, there are a large amount of well-known actors who are not a good pattern in showing the right way of success.

To sum up, I personally agree that although many celebrities set negative influences on teenagers,at least many others of them are useful in showing the way that they work hard to the younger individuals."
"Nowadays, celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people. 

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","In this present times, celebrities becoming known for their glamour and wealth rather than their achievements are setting bad examples to the young people. I vehemently agree with this given statement. This essay will expound my on my point of view and provide credible examples.

Firstly, the most discernible aspect is that it corrupts the minds of the young ones that material and physical things are most important. To clarify properly, the young people will neglect values like diligence and perseverance and will just focus on how to become rich and famous. An optimal example of this can be the business tycoons, where they are known on how many corporations they have. Little that the youth knows that it was due to their hardwork and determination that bought those business tycoons on where they are now.

Another point worth considering is the neglection of talents and skills. It is deemed that achievements accomplished by an individual is what makes him a significant figure of the society. For instance, Elon Musk is repsonsible for the  successful production of Tesla car, a fully powered electric vehicle. But unfortunately, people only knew him of being the wealthiest man in the world.

In conclusion, celebrities are setting bad examples to the young people of today due to the fact that what they have accomplished and achieved are blanketed by their glamour and wealth. The celebrities as well as the society should be role models for the youth for them to grow up and be a respectable individuals."
"Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example for many young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In our time, celebrities are more popular for their luxury and money than for their attainments, and this can lead to a negative sample for many teenagers. I completely disagree with this statement, that’s why it depends on each person’s character and lifestyle. 

To begin with, from my point of view, this condition relies on each person's images and types. I can exemplify famous people who are well-known for their success, abilities, and accomplishments. For instance, Cristiano Ronaldo. He was born and raised in a very miserable and poor family. Nevertheless, he is now one of the best and most skilled footballers in the world. Even though he is very rich now, he never forgets his past and does not spare his help to the poor and needy families. In addition, despite being a Christian, he helped millions of Muslims. This shows that he is very merciful. 

Moreover, everyone has a different own choice and glance, and this opinion cannot belong to all populations. There are some people on social media platforms who make great contributions to our society. In particular, I can mention language, art, also, music teaching, and scientific accounts. These famous people try to help us to learn a lot of things from their accounts.

To sum up, a prominent society can impact the young-aged community. I believe that if children make the right decision and start to follow the proper people, it can lead to them positively."
"Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","In recent years, many celebrities are famous because of the glamour and wealth rather than for their accomplishments. While I strongly agree with this statement because of a negative example for teenagers such as influence on children’s life and highly financed usage. Some celebrities' skills might be average even though they are rich and become young people’s idols.

Firstly, influence on the children’s life in the social media platform. This is because famous people such like actors, actresses, singers, models or sports stars take their picture and video, put it on IG, Facebook and Twitter  regularly, to create more fans. A good example would be Justin Biber, who is rich and famous in the world. Everyday he posts where he goes, sometimes he attends parties, pubs or clubs and he has many tattoos on his body. This message to young people is that they want to be the same as their idol, and many young people get a tattoo on their skin and become bad behavior.

	Secondly, highly financial usage is another reason why it is not good for teenagers. The famous people promote many branded accessories for their job, so children want to buy or use and force their parents to buy high quality branded things. For example, HERA Company hired Jenny, who is a very famous Kpop group (BlackPink) member to advertise their latest makeup collection. She is pretty, slim, and smooth skin. And she takes makeup tutorials to use every brush or every shade and lipstick, young people think that is the only way one can look beautiful. The kind of highly paid celebrities have the ability to pay to get what they need, therefore young children are not similar to famous people. 

	Despite the possibility of children developing their talents, there are far more negative examples for the younger generation. I extremely agree to this because of the influence on the young people's life and top level financial usage."
"Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, those famous people frequently show off their estates and luxuries to the masses, thus gaining followers on the websites without being famous for their contribution to  society. Some adolescents may follow this trend and it will be a harmful phenomenon for them. As far as I am concerned, I agree with this opinion.

To begin with, It is admitted that this trend may be conducive to the young people's work efficiency. The reason is that the property of celebrities may appeal to those youngsters who  yearn for wealth, and then they will work hard to obtain a well-paid job, so that they can boost their living standard. For example, many undergraduate students aimed to purchase a luxury case endorsed by some influencers, so they worked fairly hard to increase their income so that they could fulfil the dream. However, I still reckon that the downsides of this tendency can't be neglected.

We can attain plenty of wealth and fortune from fame, but fame sometimes backfires. To be more specific, the overstated persuasion of fame instead of achievements sometimes leads to ignorance of  their bad behaviours. For instance, some influencers like Wu Yifan and Wanglihong didn't show  upright conduct to the young person. Instead, they cheated their families. Unbelievably, their fans even refused to acknowledge what they did before. In addition, many young students who were misguided by some misconduct even imitated some disgusting behaviour done by some celebrities which caused  unrest in big cities only because they thought that these were intriguing to them.

In conclusion, although this trend sometimes can be beneficial to young people's work productivity, I still insist that the detrimental aspect of this trend definitely overwhelms the advantage it brings to youngsters, because sometimes it will cause their misconduct  the society, which will have a harmful effect on their life."
"Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for
their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","In today's time, money and glamour have been given more importance rather than achievements when it comes to celebrities, and this is giving a bad influence on the mind of the young generation. I agree with the statement, however, it is not completely true. 

It is true, those famous people are followed by millions of followers, especially on social media platforms.  But some celebrities have started showing off their wealth and their glamourous life on the internet, instead of telling the story of their struggle and hard work.This has affected the minds of the admirers, and it is leading them in the  wrong direction. Moreover, they mindlessly imitate the life of their idol without giving second thoughts. To make it simple, researchers have shown that, 30% of youth are addicted to drugs and alcohol nowadays, because of the celebrities they are following.

However, some folks get motivation by following the life of their famous celebrities or business person. They get a reason to work hard with dedication and an aim to reach the top of their goal. Some business person uses their wealth as a medium to educate people and motivate them, and make them understand the value of life and struggle. For example, according to the survey, 30 per cent of people gets motivation through watching the stories of wealthy and famous businessmen.

To be concluded, wealth and glamour promoted by personality are truly affecting the lives of the common man. Today's youth is going to bad track because of such movie stars. However, this showoff is a motivation for some people struggling in the same field as that of the celebrity."
"Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth rather than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people. To What extent do you agree or disagree?","The public figures act as role models for teenagers and `influence their life in several ways. The youth get mesmerised by the popularity and wealth of cabrerites. I withstand the idea that some of the famous people indulge in flaunting their possessions and looks to gain publicity however there are some people who use their fame to inspire youth.

To begin with, there are influential figures whose actions or representations can adversely impact today’s new generation because the teenagers follow them blindly. These people convey the message of being rich and beautiful is the ultimate success of growth. For instance, the entertainment industry put a lot of emphasis on good looks which promote body shaming in society. Many youngsters follow diet plans to attain ideal body shape which resulted in eating disorders and low self-esteem.

On the contrary, there are people who show the right path to teens by setting an example of hard work, persistence and intelligence for coming generations. These kinds of people have high values in their personal domains which reflects in their work too. To illustrate, the Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar is a determined, hardworking and disciplined person who mostly do make movies on social subjects such as woman’s rights to access better sanitation; third gender rights to reduce the impacts of social stigmas.

To sum up, in my opinion, celebrities can influence teens in both ways positively as well as negatively. It is the moral responsibility of influencers to utilise their power to give the right direction to their followers and try to make difference in others life."
"Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","In recent years, most of the famous people are living a wealthy and high-quality lifestyle. Thus, made many youngsters trying to follow celebrities steps. I strongly believe that it is completely wrong to have their lives as an example in normal life.

there are many reasons for my disagreement, in this essay, I will represent some of the causes.

Firstly, in my view, I clearly find that most of the celebrities, as actress, fashionists, car racers and football players, are not an excellent example for young people. Obviously, many of them are wealthy due to the overpriced salary or some of the advertisements they have been making, without an affective reward to society.

secondly, some of the famous people would be a bad influence to adolescents, for instance, they are not well educated or not even had a grade, but by their glamourous lives, many of adolescents will blindly imitate their attitudes. 

Moreover, some of the high school students will be seduced by wealthy life of celebrities and easy earning money and as a result, they may quit studying and forget to focus on their future and neglect the fact that is important to have a secure job for the real world.

Overall, In my opinion, the sparkling lives of famous people had a negative impact on younger generations.

To conclude, even though fancy life and the fame are dreams to some people, young people should pay more attention to their school and to the real achievements because that is what they need most in a competitive world."
Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements and this sets a bad example to the young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In this era, exposure of money and fashion by celebrities is becoming increasingly popular. The youth is getting influenced in wrong direction by famous personalities who are well known for their looks and richness than their talent. This essay will discuss how renowned person leave bad impact on young generation.
Celebrities have great influence on young ones. Social media plays a vital role to make a ordinary person turning into famous personality overnight and helps to make them look extraordinary. No matter what, if the person lacks any talent but exceptionally good in showing off money will get famous soon. For example, a rich person can post a vedio of riding his/her lastest car on snapchat,instagram or facebook and that vedio will be liked by million of people around the world, that's how they get recognised. In short, young generation is easily attracted to materialistic world rather than appaulding actual talent."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Most of the superstars of current era are known for their lavish lifestyle and bank balance rather than their accomplishments and it is a bad example for the youngsters. In my opinion, I completely agree with this statement as not only does this practice deviate youngsters’ minds from studies but it also makes them set unrealistic ambitions.

Firstly, the possessions of celebrities attract teenagers while luring them away from the studies. Students in their teens are the ones most attracted to celebrities. The superstars often showcase their supposedly content life around all the materialistic things they have earned. Teenagers are most vulnerable among their audience and they waste a lot of time and money following them. By the time they realize, the professional life is already knocking at the door.

Secondly, the extravagant lifestyle of the celebrities encourages youngsters to fantasize about unrealistic goals. There is so much competition in the entertainment industry that only 3% of the people trying to become a superstar actually make it big in their lives. The youngsters fail to realize this and focus with all their might, on becoming like their idols. After multiple attempts at it, they are often left broke and wondering which career path to choose.

In conclusion, I agree that the trend of following hyped up celebrities becomes a reason for lack of education and meaningless wander for the youngsters. The dreams of the youngsters are manipulated by materialistic attraction and it is often too late when this is realized."
"Some think that governments should support retired people financially while others believe they should take care of themselves.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","It is irrefutable that senior citizens are the most vulnerable members of our society and are often financially supported in enormous developed economies. In numerous nations around the world, elderly people accrue funds for themselves that give them a sense of independence and curtail the financial burden on a province.

In this contemporary era, people prefer to become financially independent by accumulating funds for their golden years. It gives them a sense of independence and self-respect. The government of Canada encourages pupils for financial planning  so that their citizens can lead a stress-free and luxurious old age.

Moreover, this approach is beneficial to curtail the financial budget of a country. Instead of distributing money among senior citizens, the government can invest these funds for development such as infrastructure refurbishment. This would captivate the influx of tourists, hence, a country's economy will boost. A multitude of dollars were invested by the government of Indonesia to restore their historical buildings which attract thousands of visitors every year. As a result, their revenue increased precipitously. 

Financial support to older generations is their fundamental right and the onus of the legitimate agencies. This is because retired people have paid huge tariffs during their working years and contribute toward a country's development to a great extent. Therefore, it is the obligation of the financial ministry to pay them back for their hard-earned money.

Even though elderly people have paid a significant amount of taxes to the government, I firmly believe that becoming financially independent not only gives a sense of freedom and self-respect but also reduces the financial burden on a nation. Thus, they should take care of their monetary needs by themselves and not rely on legal affirms."
"Directors of large organizations earn much higher salaries than ordinary employees do. Some people think it is necessary, but others are of the opinion that it is unfair. Discuss both views and give your own opinions.","Big co-operates and multinational companies are led by leaders who are paid with high wages that they deserve.This is due to the fact that they are highly educated ,hardworking and showed remarkable skillsets in their fields.But the ordinary employees are provided less amount of money due to a number of factors such as years of experience and kind of studies.In my opinion, the directors of big enterprises have to receive the best payment compared to common workers.

First and foremost,individuals in  leadership positions usually possess a high quality of education from great universities .In addition to that,  they own more number of experience in their areas and they are experts in their domain.They might have tried so hard and faced numerous challenges to attain that role.Consequently, the organizations are liable to pay them immensely.For instance,the director of the brand Pepsico has reached that role due to her immense amount of effort throughout her career.

On the contrary,  regular staffs might not have done several years of work .Also,they might not have proper degrees or masters to fit in a bigger role.For reaching such a stage, they have to do lots of hard work.These all factors constitute  the reason for the lower payment of the usual workforce.However, there are people who bargain for huge money in return for their job without eligibility.

To sum up,the main head of an establishment has to be salaried exceptionally as they are worthy enough for it.Also,other workers have to be paid according to their efforts and experience.Students and the younger generation can learn many things from inspiring leaders."
Only government action can solve housing shortages in big cities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Housing shortages in big cities are a common issue we are facing nowadays. Many folks believe that only the government  is able to solve this problem. However, from the way I am thinking, I do not agree with this idea.

On the one hand, it is undeniable that one of many government responsibilities is to ensure that the residents have houses to live in. I am convinced that all the councils in the world, regardless of the region where the cities are based. I remember a friend of mine once said that in his home country, the executive prepared and constructed buildings to accommodate the citizens. I was blown away when I heard this and imagined if the government in my homeland do the same thing. However, I realize that there are other, arguably more emerging, issues that are faced by the government, that need to be solved first. So waiting for the government to singlehandedly solve the housing issue is not a wise move we can do as a resident, especially if we are not from the richest country on this planet.

On top of the government, I strongly believe that other players also play the same key role in this issue, the private sector for instance. They can contribute to tackling the issue in their own ways. Whereas banks can help its customer  get a friendly loan to buy a house, property companies could provide an easy scheme to pay for the houses. Those are only two of many examples of how private sectors are able to help. What I want to say is that only government  can solve this issue. 

To sum up, I do not agree with people who think that only the executive can break down the problem as I strongly believe either government or non-government can help on their own, as aforementioned explanations."
Housing shortages in big cities can cause severe social consequences. Some people think that only government action can solve this problem. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In metropolitan cities, the shortage of accommodation is getting a bigger problem for the citizens, whereas many believe that the government is the one who can tackle this calamity with their own rules. I agree with this statement, and I will fortify my views in the following paragraphs.

To begin with, in my mind, the populaces are moving to the cities for various reasons. For reasons, it could be a job or a university education. I just recently read one article, students have different opinions, many say, that admission to a university is far easier rather than finding space for living, and it is irrefutable, for instance, the article delineated that is this not a problem for one country, it is a global delinquent, and everyone is suffering with it. For example, in Ireland, finding a flat is trickier than having a seat in the institute. Humans are obliged to pay a very high amount of money to live, they feel unfair and is true. Many of them sleep in their vehicle due to a shortage of space. All over the globe, most students are in a trouble rather than anyone else. Nevertheless, international students have several disruptive than the locals.

 On the other hand, the administration must pay attention to resolve this matter, and I am sure they can because having the power they are more eligible to look out for this tension. In addition, many countries had a law for infrastructure and people must follow them, likewise, if they look through all the perspectives and ease some law enforcement about the residential structure then it could be possible to get this phenomenon. For example, if the population will be allowed to build multistore buildings maybe we can get a solution for living. Although to my knowledge, many nations are eager to retain this challenge by putting bunkers, it is not a permanent cure. 

In conclusion, the shortage of space has created a crisis among the citizens. Government must go through this and try to change their laws about infrastructures unless in the future it will be a huge burden for all nations."
The shortage of housing in big cities can cause severe consequences. Only government action can solve this problem.  To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Since   a number of   ,years  population  from   the countryside  move to big   metropolis  for various reasons and   ,consequently  capital   center  have   a  shortage of housing. In   this  case,   the national  government is the only one to tackle   this  issue. I am fully agreed that   the governer  has the main responsibility to have sufficient housing in commercial   cities  to prevent unnecessary side   effect  . The main reason that causes the shortage of housing in   downtown  is increasing the population day by day who migrate from countryside  to work as the daily workers   ,especially  in construction sectors and many industries.   society  are moving to   center  which offer   greater employment and   a higher  standard of living.   For instance  , most of the   city's  life can access   the internet  , mobile banking,   and convenient  transportation system.   As a result  , accommodation places are more and more demanding   significantly  for   blue-collar  workers who can only afford   a low  budget   houses  .   Additionally  ,   several  side   effects  has been occurred   such  as   water  shortage and electricity   getting  by hourly.   Moreover  , accommodation and domestic   water  supply cannot be separated in urban life. If the population and urban   water  system ratio   are  not equal, there will be many  consequences  related to   people's  health   problems  ,   for example  ,   people  cannot use sufficient   water  amount for their   water  and sanitation purposes. Another particular   problem  of big city life is   having  good   practices  and management system of household waste. If the governments cannot control daily waste, the diseases   of diaherra  and flu can be spread easily. In   this  case,   people  have to spend extra charges for their health. To prevent the   problem  mentioned above, only   the head  of the nation can be solved the   problem  because they have   the responsibilities  to support to be a developed country and it requires   a huge  amount of money to build sufficient housing in   the country’s  gateway  cities"
"The shortage of housing in big cities can cause severe consequences.  Only government action can solve this problem.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","The acceleration of industrialization and the prosperity of the economy benefit our society a great deal . But the lack of housing designed for the community to live in big cities is a serious problem and the consequences can be bad. Only the ministry can solve such problems. I completely  agree with this situation.  I will explain my opinion in  my essay.

There are several damages to housing the lack in cities. That is  it significantly worker's the community's quality of life. In other words,when there are few houses in the city , the nation moves to the villages ,which significantly reduces the quality of living standards.  It also leads to a shortage of workforce power in various large factories.  Yes,of course ,this is  a serious shortcoming for society and the regime.  

On the other hand,  politics will definitely solve this problem because it is responsible.  The state is trying to solve these problems but it has other problems as well. A variety of large factories and plants can deal with these issues 

For example, f the factory builds separate housing for its workers, there will be no shortage in the city. In addition,  if a variety of opportunities are created for businessmen today, that is , if multi-storey houses or homes are built for them to live and it will benefit not only the family of the town  but also the reputation of the town.

To sum up, not only the politics is responsible for the shortage of houses in the community but also factories are somewhat responsible."
"""The shortage of housing in big cities can cause severe consequences. Only government action can solve this problem.
 
To what extent do you agree or disagree?""","With urbanisation, the population in cities is growing fast and so is the housing crisis, which brings along many other problems. Some argue that only government is the appropriate authority to deal with this rising problem. I strongly agree with this argument as governments can solve this growing issue by various steps, such as restricting new landed residential housing by encouraging vertical apartment buildings and gradually expanding cities.

First and foremost, the government is the right party to resolve this housing crisis issue by discouraging the building of new landed houses and encouraging vertical multi-storey apartment living with proper planning and infrastructure to deal with this space crunch. For example, Singapore and Hong Kong are cities on islands and they have proven to solve this crisis for their citizens by vertically building thousands of high-floor flats. These cities have proved to incorporate the best infrastructure for their ever-growing population by building multi-story apartments rather than new houses, which has resulted in economically affordable housing for their citizens in big cities. Further, to help the situation, the government can extend highways to help commuters access the cities in a country easily. This high level of planning can only be done by the government to help solve accommodation shortages for their citizenry.

Secondly, the government can help this situation by expanding cities and creating more residential properties on the outskirts of cities. In Noida, for instance, a fast-growing city in India, the housing development board has continuously helped accommodate the growing population by building more residential properties on the outskirts of the city which eventually became part of it and built metros and highways for commuters to make it easily accessible. Hence, this helped in controlling growing cramping and accommodation problems for their locals. 

In conclusion, it is clear that the government has a big role to play as an ultimate authority by taking appropriate measures to create highly planned inner-by city development and well-designed infrastructure to accommodate the growing needs of their citizens."
Only government action can solve housing shortages in big cities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is not uncommon across the world that people flood into a metropolis seeking for better working opportunities. One inescapable consequence of such massive migration is the housing shortage, which again brought about a series of chain effect: soaring house prices, unbearable burden on the working class, to name but a few. Therefore, governments are burdened with the task to provide an effective and proper solution. However, individuals as well as corporations all have a role to play.

Certainly, government, with all the resources at its disposal, plays an essential part in tackling the problem. This is decided by the essence of executive. In the primitive age, there was no such thing as administration. As activities of human beings became more complex, a middle is needed to coordinate and manage the tribe. So the  rule is such a body empowered by its people to organize and take responsibility for the social affairs.  However, that is not to say that government should fight alone in the battle against the “house shortage”. After all, the citizens themselves are the direct victims and beneficiaries in this battle. Actually, there is much can be done by us to alleviate the house pressure.  As a matter of fact, as more and more people crowed in big cities, the job market there has already saturated.
. Another  plausible approach is to build infrastructures like market or retail stores  in small cities where land charge is inexpensive. In that way, companies can save a sum of money buying the land, and more job vacancies are created in small cities, thus attracting more job hunters.

To conclude, it is the government’s essential role to solve the social problem since government can pool resources of all sorts. But, bearing in mind that we are living in a “one for all, all for one” society. If each one makes a small sacrifice, the problem will be solved soon. In addition, a corporation can also be counted on"
The shortage of housing in big cities can cause severe consequences. Only governments actions can solve this problem. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is undeniable that low-quality house construction in big cities can lead to negative outcomes related to people’s lives. I personally believe that authorities are the only organizations that can address this issue.

On the one hand,  high-quality accommodation requires a huge investment which most people can not afford, causing the lack of houses with good conditions resulting in a need for government support. In other words, besides housing, people have to spend their money on other essential services and food, contributing to a consideration for balance expenses. Consequently, individuals with limited budgets take a small amount of money to pay for low-quality housing regardless of risks related to safety. As a result, it is necessary for administrations to be in charge of raising house funds to lend to residents with low interest if they use the loans for good housing. Furthermore, governments can diversify levels of taxes, applying lower taxes for communities with low incomes, helping them to decrease tax burdens, contributing to consideration for better accommodations.

On the other hand, authorities need to enact stricter regulations for house construction processes. The lack of integrity in housing establishments from some organizations is observing an upward trend. It means that they decrease housing investment budgets for personal purposes causing lower amounts of money that can merely afford low-quality building materials, consequently attributed as a main reason for the shortage of housing. Hence, in order to address the aforementioned issue, authorities are the sole institutions which have sufficient power to control this bad situation by banning heavy fines for individuals who are working illegally.

In conclusion, the housing crisis caused by the deficiency of quality can be solved by no one except authorities as they can apply supporting methods and regulations to improve the occurrence"
"The shortage of housing in big cities can cause severe consequences.  Only government action can solve this problem.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Presently, in numerous cosmopolitan sites, urbanization causes a problem which is a plethora of people do not have a sufficient settlement. As a way to address this issue, there is a notion that assistance from the authorities is required. I agree with the proposed idea and in the following paragraphs, there will be explanations of my consideration.

To begin with, massive cities like Jakarta and Singapore are able to master this issue by supporting a program such as constructing vertical apartments. From the previous illustration, obviously, this occasion cannot be done by other stakeholders such as society. Several activities such as releasing policies and providing appropriate areas are the government's responsibility. As a result, they have a massive portion in order to obliterate this social problem. For instance, the local administration in Jakarta constructed vertical construction to be used by an enormous population.

Furthermore, providing habitable settlements to societies as a way to stop the negative implications from urbanization requires communal collaboration among stakeholders. For example, the government's assistance is needed to create mutual understanding among several elements such as local people and newcomers in order to minimize conflicts. In addition, long-term impacts will exist and some effects on ecology can be concerned exceptionally by public policymakers. Consequently, housing problems might be solved if they are handled by the administrative element.

To conclude, I agree that the shortage of settlement issues can be obliterated exceptionally by the governments in view the policymakers can create mutual understanding among people  concerning the long-term implications of making appropriate houses."

"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school","In the current era, the debate over whether a diploma offers more advantages compared to getting a business. Some argue that starting a successful career depends on studying bachelor's or college, while others contend that  securing employment is the best option after graduating from school. In my opinion, by enrolling in higher education, students can find enrollment.

Convincing arguments can be made that getting a job provides  experience and more effective strategies. To start with, while youngsters are working in their workplace, they might be able to improve their practical ability as well as gaining interpersonal experience. For instance, although the world is undergoing  rapid change as a result it leads to increasingly competitive job sphere, every specific industry and company`s employers do not want to recruit a volunteer who has a lack of practice. Hence  improving skills that perceiving the atmosphere of real working in their adulthoods can help them prosper in their fields. 

Despite the positives of getting an occupation mentioned above, I would acknowledge that enrolling educational institution has numerous benefits. One of the desirable aspects of studying is  enhancing cognitive skills such as critical thinking, and broader understanding of the world may increase good quality of a career. Additionally,  high global perspectives which enhance long-term career prospects can provide adults with a financial budget for their entire lives. For example, doctor or teacher and these categories of jobs always require a specialist who has sufficient ability for work. 

To conclude, while getting a job has its positives, particularly gaining experience, the predominant advantage of studying at university and college is enhancing long-term career success."
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believes that it is better to get a job straight after school. discuss both views and give yur opinion","Although it is considered by some people that the best way to secure a good job is being a university graduate, there are others who think that starting work after school is a better option. From my perspective, deciding to work is beneficial in the field of business, whereas completing university coursework is the most useful in an academic career.

On the one hand, it is attractive to find work after school, according to some people because they will have the opportunity to gain hands-on experience related to their chosen profession and acquire top soft skills such as time management, leadership and flexibility. This results in promotions and a successful career. For example, not only has the job market been increasingly becoming competitive, but there is also an overwhelming number of applicants for one position in a company. Therefore, it is commonly believed by some people that learning key soft skills can be valuable to a company and having relevant experience in that line of 

work , which can put one ahead of the game when they apply for the position. 

On the other hand , some people think that it is more advantageous to pursue higher education after school. Since obtaining a academy certificate is an indicator of perseverance, passion and commitment needed to study a degree course for three or four years, a university degree is convincing proof of the competence of the applicants. As a result , most employers will be more impressed by candidates who have qualifications from a academy than those with fewer qualifications, which in turn leads educational institution graduates not only to better job opportunities but also to higher incomes.

 In conclusion, even though community may vary in their opinions, I think that being a successful career requires a relevant background either in tertiary education or effort experience depending on the type of endeavor and field."

Discuss both views an give your opinion.","Nowadays, many people claim that attending a place of further education is the best way to achieve success in a career, while others think that it is preferable to start work instant after school. This writter is of the opinion that the former opinion is the best choice.

First of all, the main reason that some people enter the workforce right after high school job that is do not have enough money to study university. But this option have both advantages and disadvantages. When young adults left school at 18 and getting a job, they can have more chance to deal with the public that can improve social skills, or students can make many new contacts that maybe bring a host of opportunities for them. On top of that, students can be financially independent, that is lessly use money from their parents, they also can buy anything they want or that neccessary for themselves.

On the other hand, leaving school at 18 and go to university or college have a variety of benifits such as they would have more academic knowledge, it is very likely to stand a greater chance of landing a well-earned job. Furthermore, study in university and college can make new friends that good for social skills. In this modern era, people need to develope themselves to catch up the progress of mordenization, so that it is crucial that students bachelor degree's holder.

In conclusion, the most important things that is study, maybe go to university not a best way achieve success but that is the fast way to reach one. Learning is virtual for everyone."
"some people believe that studying at university or college ist the best route to a succesful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after graduating from high school. Discuss both views and give your opinion","It is argued that bachelor degree's holders should carry on their studies at college to get a dream profession. However, some people believe that entering the workforce right after high school is the right thing to do. I agree with the former statement and will explain the reason why in the following essay.

It must be acknowledged that thousands of applications are sent to universities, both private and public, every year. The most crucial reason behind this trend is that when they are taking tertiary education, they will be taught by well-respected professors and industry experts, who will guide them through their study journey and analyze their specialties. Then they can find out if they are suitable for the job and may decide to change their career before getting an undesirable job. 

Additionally, during their time at universities, they can enjoy social life with all the clubs and societies, as well as work in the companies as interns. In the future, they can be used to enrich your CV and make it different from others. Extensive research has consistently shown that more and more firms and corporations are also interested in the university and community activities besides grades. In 2022, it is estimated that 507,300 job applications that consist of those activities are accepted in Vietnam.

 Those against a higher education emphasize practical skills and valuable contacts. They argued that instead of taking boring lectures, they can both cultivate relevant job skills and transferrable skills. Therefore, they will have more experience in the field than the seniors. Furthermore, they will develop a useful network of people working in the same industries, which might help them later on. This point had credibility, but most companies are still in favor of employing university graduates as they've trained properly and academically.  

In conclusion, while both ways can lead us to our goal in career, it is easier to get a high-paid occupation if you enroll in tertiary education. This way can help you get more job opportunities and have access to high-powered positions."

In my opinion, I totally believe that having university education is very crucial, however, having a job is also a good choice.

On the one hand, going to university is the best approach. First reason is that there will be more opportunities for who have a good qualifications. Take an example, having a good diploma or higher degrees, you will be hunted by headhunters from popular companies which then you would stand a greater chance of landing a well-paid job. The second reason, it is worthwhile to get knowledge from university or college which is the tool supporting almost of your works. Furthermore, many people say that “The more knowledge you get, the more opportunities you could gain.”. Indeed, graduating from a university where you will have many advices from experts so you would find it is more easily get a job from popular  companies.

On the other hand, getting a straight job after school also have some benefits. Many people believe that having a job suddenly after school is better because they can earn money as soon as possible. Nowadays, many have ideal that going further after school is unnecessary and it is also more expensive so they prefer to earning money suddenly after school. However, if they want get more many, they have to work longs hour with a low salary instead of working in a friendly environment, working nine-to-five and having a high paid. One more justification is that working after school is very fitting for whom want to get a plenty of experiences and soft skill, therefore, they can be a headquarter of the queue when applying for a position in the business.

To sum up, working straight at 18 allows people have work experiences and soft skill when they applying for job. However, people should make sure that gaining enough knowledge and specialist skills before applying for in order to have a successful career and also a dreaming life."

While others assume that it is preferred to be employed after leaving high school. This essay attempts to discuss both views and provide my perspective which is finishing university or college is more beneficial.

On the one hand, there is an attractive option for having an occupation as soon as leaving school is soft capabilities achievement. Because of employing in a new environment, students have opportunities to contact many kinds of people and characters which are partly different from the educational environment. This act helps young individuals develop their potential, not only working skills but also soft skills such as public speaking, negotiation and so on. For example, students from HV Academy always have the highest rate of acceptance. 

On the other hand, I completely believe that it is much more beneficial for students to have university or college degrees by accomplishing higher schooling due to better job choices and higher income. Firstly, because of the harsh competition in the market, loads of applications for one business are submitted every single day. Once students own a degree from a university or college, those students’ applications will be attracted noticeably by the hiring manager, which increases the possibility of acceptance. For instance,.

 In conclusion, in spite of the advantages of starting work early, I still believe that being employed after graduating from higher education is more beneficial due to its benefits."

Some individuals are in the opinion that prosperous vocation is achieved best by attending universities and colleges. Still, others believe it could be gotten without studying there. I think can't give enough knowledge for job.

   Many people opine starting to work after graduating the school is the best option as it offers some good opportunities. Firstly, it is considered that the worker who began his or her job  early will progress faster. For example: he will built career earlier and as he earns money he will be able to have their own families. Furthermore, some personalities consider that universities and colleges are vast of time and financial resources as many of them utilize almost useless information.

   In the other hand, I totally believe that joining university studies gives more opportunities than setting up to situations. First of all, the graduater of universities is more likely to have better working place, opportunities and higher job salaries than others. In fact, they also get more old age pension. For instance: my sister is a doctor and as she has university qualification, she has more patients than those without it. In addition, she always says it has a very little likelihood of taking non-qualified employees  not for the doctor labor but to the nursery for work.

   To sum up, everything depends on desire of the person both of options are  good only if the workers set a reliable goals, try their best and do no forget  not stopping to improve themselves."

First of all, a lot of people prefer studying instead of working early and I am one of them because, we think having a good degree and knowledge lets  society respect you , second, when someone has a Certificate easier to find a job in the perfect position with a large salary. Finally, studying is less difficult than working and more fun. For example, a student can study  part-time and do what he wants after that. I am a student in college in the morning also I am working as a treader at night.

In contrast, the public who want to work after graduation from school, In my ,opinion  care about money more than a career. In addition, they want to become milliners as fast as they can. My older brother  thinks like that but after he long time he  itregret. Some of people  luck was with them  like  many people in our world. For instance, Cristiano Ronaldo, Bill Gates, and others. Therefore, they think working is the best way to be successful. However, those who are hardworking and intelligent  did not become rich or famous by chance.

In my opinion, I believe that students are supposed to learn more professional knowledge to stand out in masses of future competition.

On the one hand, it is reasonable that people hope their children get a job straight after school. From a household perspective, young adults can find a job and be paid properly, which largely mitigates the pressure on finance. And, this advantage would be significantly enlarged in poor-income families where parents need the children's salaries for various payments, such as repaying loans, healthcare and so on. From an individuals' aspect, teenagers would accumulate more work experience if they enter into labour markets earlier. Students usually spend at least 4 years pursuing a B.E. in university, causing huge time consumption. If work since their graduation, they can receive more valuable experience and guidance in certain company positions.

However, we have to recognize that further studying in college provides our children with more competitiveness in their future careers. Firstly, we can enter specific schools and learn more professional knowledge and skills such as law, business, finance and science. In other words, students tend to have the same lessons in previous schools and have no access to their favourite subjects. But in college, they have an opportunity to choose certain courses they like and enter this field in the future. Secondly, the experience of campus life is an indispensable part of our life. People are more likely to meet their best friends, have the most unforgettable period and enjoy school life.  Therefore, studying in  college offers abundant

Some people assert that going to study at a university or college is the best way to start building a career, whereas many others argue that the best way is to get a job straight after school. I will explore both arguments and give my opinion.

           

             Convincing arguments can be made that studying at a university is the best way to start a career. Firstly, and most importantly, learning in a group of other students while being taught by an experienced teacher is way easier than learning on your own. For example you can share different ideas with the other students which helps you considerably to learn faster and easier. Learning from others' mistakes rather than from your own is more comfortable. It is also important to note that the connections you build in your university or college will be beneficial in your career.

          

           In contrast, some others may claim that getting a job right after school is a better way to kick start your career. Firstly and most importantly, you can start right away working towards your dreams while others spend several years studying. Those several years can be crucial, and you might find yourself in a very good position in your career already while others are still studying at a college or university. Secondly, it is also possible to learn the important skills that you get taught in a university on your own in a process of doing. While working and perhaps starting a business you will make mistakes and you will learn from your own mistakes while getting valuable working experience.

      

                Having considered both views, I think the best decision would be to balance the two. Study at a university or college while also working in a part time job. This way you will gain the most benefits."
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school.
Discuss both views and give your opinion.","It is true that teenagers face the dilemma of whether to work or continue their education after school. While there are some benefits to students getting a job straight, I believe that keep going to university or college is the best path to finding a satisfying career. In this essay, I will explain both sides in detail in the ensuing paragraphs.

Adolescents getting a career directly after high school is attractive for several reasons. Firstly, a university degree is not necessary for some industries. In Taiwan, for example, there are a few managers for service professions who assume practical training is more important. In addition, these youth would gain more work experience, become more independent, and even start earning money sooner than other peers who are students.

On the other hand, I completely agree that it is more beneficial to young people for continuing their programs at university. The major reason is a degree can open the door to better employment prospects. For instance, most jobs, such as medical professions or engineering require academic qualifications, including specific knowledge and skills. Moreover, schools aim to teach teenagers moral values such as tolerance and sharing, which prepare them to be members of society.  Therefore, once graduating from college or higher degree, they get better job opportunities, earn higher salaries, and also contribute positively to society. These indicate that higher education indeed brings some positive effects on people.

In conclusion, despite the fact that there are some advantages to going to work straight after school, it seems to me that getting a higher education is more likely to have better competitiveness in the job market."

In  this easay I will discuss both these views and give my own opinion.

        On the one hand , Parents believe that earning right after school is good for our

future  because, you start earning in your young age that after two or three years you will be the independent. For example, my cousin started his job after completed his matric and now he earn handome salary and also he have a lot of experience.Moreover,Jobs are very limited and its good that you find job in your early life.

      On the other hand, people believe thats ujobs after completed intermediate or bachelors is leading to a successful life because you get a job with excellent position and good earning because of you degree and many companies hire well educated people . For Intanse,  My sister completed her higher studies in her own country Karachi but after completed her education an international company offer her a job with double salary because she has well educated .

    In conclusion, many people doing job after school because want to be independent in quite small age and where as, many students prefer job after completing their higher education.I experience the later one because for me completing education and then doing you dream job is very crucial and leads to a successful career"

Discuss both views and give your opinion.","People often possess different points of view on whether students should curve a niche straight after graduating or not. This essay discussed both sides of this argument, and I will give my own perspective, which is studying for higher education is better.

There are some advantages of getting a job straight after school. The main reason for believing this is that freshmen have more time to try to work in different fields. Thus, they can decide which job is suitable for them or truly interested in. In addition, pupils start saving money earlier when they work straight after school. For example, many hairdressers start working after graduating from high school. They not only develop hairdressing skills but also save money monthly.

On the other hand, it is often argued that, in fact, it is better to finish a master’s degree or even a doctor of philosophy. Firstly, students can learn more professional knowledge during the class. This makes them become a competitive worker in the future. Secondly, people who have a higher educational level will easily become useful members of society. Because they have abilities to deal with complex difficulties. Finally, some companies require academic qualifications for some designed positions. For example, most financial managers have finished a master’s degree in the bank. It is reasonable because they learned more financial modules and researched more financial projects, they have enough capabilities to lead a team or a company. 

In conclusion, I believe that both sides have merits. On balance, it is my opinion that children should pursue higher education levels rather than find a job after graduating."

 Discuss both views, and give your opinion.","Many think that college and university graduates will have a successful career in the future and other says it is good to get a job after high school study. In my opinion, getting job after high school study can give early start-up but for the long term success college or university degree is mandatory for everyone to shape their career in a right way. 

Many argue that it is better to get a job after high school study because they find work is more important to earn rather than just study. Everyone have their individual choices and accordingly they shape thier career. For an example, many people join their family business during high school vacation or get a job to gain a short term experience and after this period of time they find work is more important to earn well instead planning to study further. Furthermore, many have set business plans or startups which they want to begin after high school study because they don't want to do job all their career but set-up a business in the future.

However, others believe that college and university degrees will allow themselves to enter to the fastest growing professional world because nowadays degree is the most important thing to get well packaged job. For instance, to get a job in big companies like, apple, Tata consultancy, Google, etc. bachelor or master degree is the basic requirements for everyone. Moreover, graduate studies will open up both the ways for everyone who wants to get a good job and for those who wants to start a business in the future because it gives academic skills and field projects as well which can help people to boost field experience which can lead them to shape their career in a proper way. 

To sum up, despite the benifits of starting a job after high school study, people should engage more in academic field to shape their career and by doing that they can achieve their long term goals and better living lifestyle."

However, an array of society believes that higher the education, chances of getting success in life is more, while others contend that starting to earn right after  high school will be more beneficial. In my opinion, a career path plays a vital role in choosing the education time period.

Firstly, Universities have a great set of tools and use advanced pedagogy methods, that helps students to gain profound knowledge  in a particular subject or stream, which is not possible in school. For instance, if a student wishes to become a doctor, only higher education facilitates and teaches that skill. As a result, he can treat patients and become a successful doctor, unlike low-level educators. In addition to that, he can transfer his knowledge to future generations, and make a contribution to  society.

However, educators do not need to be in higher education just to achieve smaller jobs. For example, suppose a kid who is studying in elementary wants to become a baker by the end of high school, becoming a baker is an easy career for him because he doesn't need to learn higher level just to be a baker. There are more reasons for people that do not need to study higher levels such as  interests, for ,example a student doesn't have the interest to learn more stuff and just want to do basic careers like being a maid, or a teacher, farmer, and etc. Sometimes people choose to go on their own path after finishing their schooling.

In conclusion, I believe that studying at university and college is the best route to a successful career than getting a job at a younger age. You can earn more money if you study in colleges and universities, rather than getting a job straight after your schooling. But you can earn jobs straight after your schooling too because you can get money when you are young."
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others think that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Some people think that being graduated from university and college is the right way for a career. However, another part claims that it  is superior to work after finishing high school. In this essay, I will be mentioning my statements that either view can be convenient due to people’s preference and both  statements.

First of all, developing your professional skills and your knowledge can be helpful to build a career. Nowadays, employees respect high education diplomas and look for your curriculum vitae(CV). Due to this, having that paper, it will be your map for a bright future. For example, if two people with a diploma and without it and both of them are candidates for one place. The result is that the latter will be chosen. Therefore, studying at university can play a big role in your life.

On the other hand, not only have college or university education received a prosperous occupation, but also there are a lot of successful and rich people who have abandoned it. The good illustration is that of Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, founders of ""Microsoft"" and ""Apple"" respectively. They are the richest people in the modern world. According to their experience, we can conclude that not always success comes from a good education. If you work hard on your dream, a hobby can transform into a way of earning money.

In conclusion, I would like to say that not in all situations education can provide you a prosperous future. If you work and develop yourself constantly, you will achieve your goals. Getting a high education diploma or working straight after graduation from school, is a dissection that every person claims due to his or her wishes."
"Some people believe that studying at university or colleges is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school.
Discuss both views and give your opinion.","It has always been an issue of debate that to get success in life whether an individual should opt for tertiary education or start work immediately after finish their school study. I, personally believe that one should have complete their education first and then move to any work field of their choice. This essay will elucidate both above-mentioned viewpoints followed by my personal perspective as well.

To commence with, higher education plays a vital role to give a specific path to any person's future. Since by acquiring university tuition a person can open doors to many different fields for himself, he can choose his choicest work for himself in which he finds comfortable. Besides this, college study broadens an individuals perspective and give wings to his or her dreams and help a person to achieve his or her future endeavours. This has been confirmed by a recent study in the USA that majority of college-goers with higher education have vast options for work. Thus, it is important to complete higher education first.

On the other hand, some people opine oppositely, they are saying that if a person starts his or her career straight after completing primary education that person can also get success and experience in their respective work. Since in this way a person does not need to spend a huge amount of money on education, they can start earning from an early age. Moreover, they do not have to tackle the burden of tertiary education as the just leave their study at a very early age. An article, for instance, published in ""the tribune"" has shown that there are so many successful personalities who left their school at an early age. Therefore, some people are favouring this in lieu of acquiring higher education.

In conclusion, this essay has discussed how individuals can attain better in their life with university education and others; however, prefer starting career ar early age. I would like to emphasize here that there is a lot of time in life to work and we will be doing it for the rest of our lives , but initially,it is imperative to complete education."
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful  career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Nowadays, there are two schools of thought; one who believes students should pursue higher education for a better career and second, who be of the opinion that it is better to employed directly after high school. My opinion favours the first argument, however, this essay will explore arguments for both sides of the debate and provide detailed analysis to aid readers with deciding between the two. 

Undoubtedly, higher education catapults a student forward in the path of life. Students who seek to achieve a degree tend to have a better career as opposed to students who undertake work directly after school. College studies provide streamlined knowledge according to the student's subject of interest, whereas schools provide a base of knowledge on the subject. As an illustration, students are taught general sciences in school, but they can opt for their preferred science course after they get into college.Moreover,students also get to develop advanced skills by enrolling into a higher education institute as they instil the importance of advancement in students. 

Despite the above arguments, an endorsement for skipping college can be made. Students immediately become independent after being employed after school and mature at a faster pace. They develop hands-on skills, have a better understanding of managing their finances and start to experience the ups and downs of the industrial world. Furthermore, students with a weak monetary background start contributing to their family earnings by deciding to skip higher learning academies. 

As a conclusion, I would like to state that, even though this essay analysis both sides of the argument, my take on the subject is that a student should most definitely attend college to be successful in their career."
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school.
Discuss both views and give your opinion.","There is a controversy about whether adolescents should get an occupation after secondary school or continuing their study at higher education institution to obtain success. I totally think that studying at tertiary is a better choice.
There is no denying that studying for higher degree is immensely beneficial to teenagers. First of all, should they study at university or college, they can get international-recognized certifications after graduation, which is necessary for some particular jobs. To exemplify, it is claimed that people can not accomplish jobs demanding expertise if they do not have academic degrees such as doctor, teacher and lawyer. What is more, with their in-depth and academic knowledge, they can enhance employment opportunities because employers often recruit those are professional, in addition, they can seize a suitable position as well as get promotion, which can help them to earn more income.
On the other hand, it is undoubted that working after high school is also a good choice for many youngsters. It is an alternative for those getting bored with studying so they can do some manual occupations. They can get more practical experience in actual circumstances, which is helpful as they can apply it and avoid mistakes to work more effectively. Besides, it is believed that adolescents can earn money very soon and become financially independent, which is a sign of maturity. They will learn how to manage their income and use it adequately. Therefore, they will not waste their money in buying unnecessary things. For instance, many teenagers in the Western often leave home to live without their parent’s support.
In conclusion, regardless of some benefits of getting a job after high school, I firmly concur that continuing studying is the better way to accomplish success."
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Nowadays, many people are worried about their future and they are in dilemma either to choose studying at university or college or to start workshop after completing their high secondary education. In my opinion, I completed agreed with the statement that graduating from college or university is the best pathway to get success in life.

As we know, people are encouraged to have a bright future and they get enroll at the university or college in specific course of their interest. Degree or Diploma can help us to get better job opporunities. Furthermore, it is impossible to become a doctor, lawyer or a professor without having the relavent qualification or certificates. For instance, the students who are currently pursuing their studies at colleges and their program includes a internship part, which give then a chance to work with the companies to gain some valuable experience and graded them according to their performance. Sometimes, the same companies provide them a full-time work opporunity after the graduation. So, choosing to study at unvierstiy after high school lead to the successful carrer advancement. 

On the contrary, starting workshop after the high school is also an additional considerable point. People could observe more experience by their early exposure to the workforce but they might only stick to the certain job vacancy rather than getting promoted to the higher level positions. Having skilled certificates is always a positive impression which emphasize the individuals profile for promotions. Passing High School is the basic turing point in someone's to take decision for their future betterment. 

On the gist of the whole content I would like to express that going to the university or college is the best option for every person to learn and get better opporunities. This could pave the smooth way to get succession in life."
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school.
Discuss both views and give your opinion?","As for graduates of the school, being enrolled in the University or Colleges adds a value to their life. It is often argued that this is a positive way, whilst others disagree and think that it will lead to adverse ramifications. This essay agrees that an academic education is beneficial to graduates. This essay will discuss both points of view. 

It is often argued that this is a positive development, whilst others disagree and think it will lead to adverse ramifications. This essay agrees that an increase in technology is beneficial to students and teachers. This essay will discuss both points of view. 
It is clear that the academic education has been provided skills by delivering a huge knowledge of recognized experts’ experiences. Moreover, learners will get the ability to research and learn about any subject of life. It is therefore agreed that university and college are a very worthwhile tool for career. My father is a prime example, who was working for one of the government organizations as a Chairman, and he had graduated from the Moscow’s Military Conservator as a Conductor and he brought huge achievements in the Mongolian Music World.    

However, many disagree and feel that an academic education mitigates career path. Human interaction teaches people valuable skills such as discourse, debate and empathy. Despite this, human interaction is still possible through the internet and this essay disagrees technology should be dismissed for this reason. For instance, Skype and Facebook make it possible for people to interact in ways that were never before possible.
In conclusion, while the benefits of technology, particularly the internet, allow students to tap into limitless sources of information, some still feel that people should be wary of this new phenomenon and not allow it to curb face to face interaction. However, as long as we are careful to keep in mind the importance of human interaction in education, the educational benefits are clearly positive."
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views?","Job after study is a conspicuous trend which is essential towards a student's growth and development. While some people believe that one should continue with college after school, others give preference to job. Both modes of learning should be used interchangeably, in order to achieve optimum result. This essay will expatiate on both views in detail in below mentioned paragraphs.
Firstly, the variety of knowledge at higher study is a pertinent point to consider for a successful career. If the young stars adhere to university level, they will be able to access a wide range of information, which will be useful in enormous ways. For example, a plethora of skills could be attained during obtaining the upper level of education such as vocational skills, managerial and financial skills and time-management. However, it is a time-consuming process and some time causes the financial burden on the students.
Conversely, pursuing a job after secondary education is the best-way out for the needy. For instance, in a survey conducted by a media channel, 89% of the students agree with the fact of monetary issues and as such, leaving studies meanwhile. Furthermore, such learning medium helps with the practical experience which a college lacks in.
In conclusion, learning is an inevitable process in every living life.Pursuing a job after school or study in college are vital towards resource availability and personal needs. One should adhere to option which suits them the best way possible considering the constraints."
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believes that it is better to get a job straight after school.","Although it is considered by some people that the best way to securing a good job is being a university graduate, there are others who think that starting work after school is a better option. In my opinion, deciding to work is beneficial in the field of business, whereas completing university coursework is most useful in an academic career.
On the one hand, it is attractive to find work after school, according to some people because they will have the opportunity to gain experience related to their chosen profession and acquire top soft skills such as time management, leadership, flexibility, and teamwork. This results in promotions and a successful career. For example, not only has the job market been increasingly becoming competitive, but there are also sometimes an overwhelming number of applicants for one position in a company. Therefore, it is commonly believed by some people that learning key soft skills that can be valuable to a company and having relevant experience in that line of work can put one ahead of the game when applying for the position.
On the other hand, some people think that it is more advantageous to pursue higher education after school. Since obtaining a university certificate is an indicator of perseverance, dedication, passion, commitment, and intelligence needed to study a degree course for three or four years, a university degree is a convincing proof of the competence of the applicants. As a result, most employers will be more impressed by candidates who have qualifications from a university than those with fewer qualifications, which in turn leads university graduates not only to better job opportunities, but also to higher incomes.
Finally, in my view, deciding whether to continue study beyond school level or start work straight after school should depend on the position being applied for. It is impossible to become a doctor, lawyer, or teacher without having academic qualifications, for instance. In business, however, it is more important for young people to get real experience and learn useful skills through work early so that they will be able to step into a position without further training and consequently be an immediate benefit to the company. Hence, people should ensure that they attain the relevant degree or indispensable skills before applying for a job in order to be successful in their careers.
In conclusion, even though people may vary in their opinions, I think that being a successful career requires the relevant background either in tertiary education or work experience depending on the type of work and field."

Discuss both views and give your opinion","There is always a conflict for a student whether to aim towards getting work or opt for a graduate degree. Some people think it is favourable to go for higher studies, however, others believe it is best to get a job immediately after school. In this essay, we will discuss both the views and provide evidence on why it is better to go to a university or college.

On one side, there are individuals who argue that opting for skilled labour as soon as a student finishes the secondary education is more preferable as it has its own perks. One of the main reasons, students currently choose to get the work after secondary education is because they want to be independent. For example, today's teenager thinks that, as soon as they start working, they can earn money and get settled by themselves rather than depending on others. This thought of being self-sufficient and independent has pushed a lot of youngsters today in getting placements soon after schooling.

On the contrary, it is often argued that having a degree from a university or an institute has been always beneficial for an individual as it will yield them to get a successful career in a sector where there is a requirement for a graduate certificate. For instance, to acquire a job in the field of doctor, teacher or lawyer a specific area of degree is compulsory. One cannot obtain such a profound career without having an academic background. Therefore, having a higher qualification is essential to have a better job opportunity.

In conclusion, I would say that it is always more enticing for youngsters these days to grab the opportunity of working and settling after the school finishes, nonetheless, in my perspective to pursue a specialized occupation, it is necessary to have a proper education from a recognized institution or university."
"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","When they finish school, teenagers face the dilemma of whether to get a job or continue their education. While there are benefits to getting a job straight after school, I would argue that it is better to go to college or university. 
The option to start work straight after school is attractive for several reasons. Many young people want to start earning money as soon as possible. In this way, they can become independent, and they will be able to afford their own house or start a family. In terms of their career, young people who decide to find work, rather than continue their studies, may progress more quickly. They will have the chance to gain real experience and learn practical skills related to their chosen profession. This may lead to promotions and a successful career. 
On the other hand, I believe that it is more beneficial for students to continue their studies. Firstly, academic qualifications are required in many professions. For example, it is impossible to become a doctor, teacher or lawyer without having the relevant degree. As a result, university graduates have access to more and better job opportunities, and they tend to earn higher salaries than those with fewer qualifications. Secondly, the job market is becoming increasingly competitive, and sometimes there are hundreds of applicants for one position in a company. Young people who do not have qualifications from a university or college will not be able to compete. For the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that students are more likely to be successful in their careers if they continue their studies beyond school level.

"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views.","Right after finishing high school, teenagers often wonder whether they ought to continue their education or get a job. While many people believe that keeping on studying at a college or university will be the best way to guarantee a successful career, others claim that working straight after school is a better option.

Start working straight after graduation is beneficial for several reasons. Firstly, young people will be able to start earning money as soon as possible while they are working. As a result, they will be live independently on their own income and mature enough when they income money. Secondly, a person who decides to look for a job rather than pursuing higher education is likely to have a chance to obtain a lot of real experience and practical skills. This may lead them to progress more quickly in their chosen profession.

On the other hand, some people argue that it is more beneficial for young people to continue their studies after high school. Firstly, a college education prepares students to meet academic qualifications, which most employers require nowadays. Consequently, university graduates usually have opportunities to earn higher salaries than those without qualifications. For instance, the job market is becoming increasingly competitive since hundreds of applicants often chase one position in an organization. Having a degree is an obvious advantage that university graduates have. For example, In many countries, students who graduate with an engineering degree are highly paid and have an easy time getting a good job.

In conclusion, it is true to say that both working straight after high school and continuing higher-level studies each has their own unique advantages."
"The education of young people is highly prioritized in many countries. However, educating adults who cannot write or read is even more important, and governments should spend more money on this.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","The provision of funding and building structures to promote adult education should take utmost priority as against the education of younger generation by any Government. This essay tends to discuss the merits and demerits of the government focusing and developing adult education as against the younger generation.

Education is for all ages and should not be limited to the younger generation.  One of the key merits of adult education is that it gives the older generation a sense of belonging in the society. As we are all aware, the society is evolving with advanced technology daily and the only way to keep pace with what is happening in the world today is constant learning. Therefore, a society with more uneducated adults will give room for bad governance, decline growth rate and mismanagement of resources.   

In addition, it is important for the government to provide adequate structures and funding to promote adult education reason being leaders who can neither read nor write but occupy leadership positions, will hinder the economy growth of any country. As a result, adults should be encouraged to keep learning at all cost as it promotes creative thinking and active mind. No country would experience any progressive economy growth if the policy makers, regulators or industry players are not able to make or take decisive actions. 

While educating the younger generation should not be neglected as the saying goes “they are the leaders of tomorrow” however, their tomorrow can only be guaranteed where the leaders steering the wheels are constantly learning to be able to preserve the resources of the country for the younger generation.  

In conclusion, it is important that any government who understands that educating adults is key to growth, would provide adequate funding in setting up structures that would supports adult education."
"Nowadays more and more people want to get things done instantly (services, information, tasks). Why is this? Do you think it is a positive or negative development?

Write at least 250 words.","In current times, the majority of individuals seem to want things to be done immediately. This concerns social services and data which they are provided with, as well as the tasks that are in need to be completed as soon as possible. Some people claim that this means our society is developing rapidly, which is favourable, however, others believe that this occurrence holds numerous negative consequences too. Due to various the opinions each party hold, the following essay will discuss both sides and present a proper summary.

On the one hand, because of getting their services done straight away, the general public benefits by saving time for the completion of other responsibilities for the rest of the day. As a result, they tend to feel productive and encouraged to work. Furthermore, by consuming more data human beings expand their knowledge in order to correspond to the contemporary standards of intelligence.

Turning to the other side of the argument, by thinking of the future constantly, and by not being in the moment, humans are at risk of neglecting reality, along with that, simple, but spectacular things are losing their value. What people should call to their minds is that beauty is in small things. Moreover, not only does society underrate stunning appearances, but also brings damage to their mental state. It is undeniable that informational overdose affects negatively the brain system and makes one feel overwhelmed and stressed. 

To conclude, I admit that it is essential not to waste time, especially in the modern world where time is a costly resource. However, it is also crucial to enjoy little things and not overload yourself."
"Nowadays more and more people want to get things done instantly (services, information, tasks). Why is this? Do you think it is a positive or negative development?","This century is called as a century of technological advancements and improvements, which has made access to everything plausible within minutes.Therefore, everyone wants their work to be prioritised and completed instantly.There are a number of factors influencing this behaviour such as excessive use of internet, mobile phones to name some.
Apparently, the current generation has cheap and fast access to the internet, which has made many tasks quite easy and can be done immediately within few clicks.For instance, for booking a train ticket earlier, a travel agent was required, which now can be done within minutes on internet.Moreover, anyone can now have a video conferencing from one part of the world to the other part of the globe with their mobile phone and internet, which was implausible few decades ago.Thus, easy, and handy access to almost everything has led to the increase of expectations of the people.
Although, these inventions have done wonders for the humankind, in my opinion, there has been a significant negative development as well.For instance, nowadays a lot of youths are experiencing anxiety issues in contrast to previous generations.Moreover, excessive use technology is having a detrimental long term effect on physical and mental health of every individual.Additionally, it has been observed that now people are less patient and hard working as compared to our ancestors.Thus, the technology upgrade has led to changes in the attitude, which is having a serious negative impact on the society.
In the nutshell, technological inventions have definitely improved quality of life, but exorbitant use is having pernicious effects as well.Therefore, it is necessary that the technology is used adequately and efficiently so that the time saved can be utilised in an effective and a productive manner."
It is important for all towns and cities to have large public spaces such as squares and parks. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"It is crucial for all metropolitan cities and towns to have some recreational facilities like parks and squares because of their numerous benefits. A number of arguments surround my opinion , and I will discuss it in upcoming paragraphs.


To commence with,  the first and the foremost merit is that it is beneficial for the health of people  because in morning time they can go for walking as well as in the evenings, also older people can spend their free time with their loved ones,and they can discuss about their daily happenings.  In addition, young people do lot of exercise in parks and gardens to keep their health fit and healthy,otherwise if there is no park they glue with electronic gadgets like mobile phones and computers and many more. 


Furthermore, little children get best place to play, they play with their friends in parks if any garden or square is not available for kids then they use roads and streets for playing it can lead to serious incidents.Moreover ,parks have some educational value too ,in schools ,students learn about environment protection in their studies and teachers can take their pupils to parks because students can see those pictures so lively which they see in their school books and they know about importance and protection of tress and flowers. 


In recapitulate, parks holds immense importance regarding education, health for people of every society ,so government should build parks in every city and town."
It is important for all towns and cities to have large public spaces such as squares and parks. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Many people argue that every city should provide public areas. I firmly believe this opinion is a great idea for several reasons.
On the one hand, common areas bring a wide range of benefits to citizens. Firstly, young people have a get-together place where they can meet up to study or play outdoor games. If there were no public places in town for junior citizens to socialize, they would take it as an excuse to interact actively with peers only through technology gadgets such as tablets, cellphones and computers, which gradually might lead to sedentary lifestyle. Secondly, squares and parks are ideal fresh-air areas for the elderly to do exercise. This especially works for those who reside in major cities with small living spaces. Because a great number of senior citizens have been complaining that their residential areas do not offer sufficient outdoor spaces which prevent them from doing regular exercise.
On the other hand, having a public park is a necessity for offering children education provision. The park with different kinds of tree is a natural source to educate offspring about natural environment as well as environment protection. For example, if geography teacher wants students to have a good understanding of how forests play a crucial role for the life of all species, the facilitators might take children to the parks and let children experience a smaller version of that of green areas and learn by seeing. Hence, this source is much better than showing pictures of national forests from somewhere else across the country. 
In conclusion, public spaces bring a great numbers of advantages for people’s health and education so these areas should be built in all cities and towns."
Argument: Some employers believe that job applicants’ social skills are more important than their academic qualifications. Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"There has been much discussion revolving around the issue of whether job applicants’ social skills are more important than their academic qualifications. In this essay, I  will explain why social skills are more vital, compared with academic qualifications. The merits of outstanding social skills are apparent.  Firstly, communication is the key to career success in this day and age. This is mainly due to the fact that the 21 st century is  best characterised by constant interaction with different people, no matter the communication happens in person or online. Secondly, the ability to sell products or services is of paramount significance in any business – this requires strong social skills. For example, an employee with excellent social skills is able to have an impact in front of customers or clients; as a result, products or services can be perceived as high-value. Furthermore, employees with better social skills are generally more easy-going, which is very important to the workplace, including the employer. After all, as the saying goes, “Who you work with is as important as what you do.” – An enjoyable work environment needs socially skilful employees. In contrast, some others may claim that academic qualifications are the pre-requisite of employment. Apparently, many positions require certain qualifications. However, in modern-day society, more and more employers have realised that whether employees can get the results that the business wants is the key to a business’ success. It can be seen that qualifications do not play a key role in this regard. Having considered both views, I think employees’ social skills are of overriding importance for an organisation. Also, I would suggest employers consider job applicants’ social skills first, which I believe is soundly based on the above reasoning I have presented."
"Some employers believe that job applicants' social skills are more important than their academic qualifications. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","There is no denying the fact that a number of employers consider focusing on social skills more than academic qualifications. 

On the first hand , nowadays , several companies are searching for workers who had quite perfect cleverness in social abilities , while they expect that it is more significant than the person who had  academic qualities . However , choosing a person with this kind of skills may return  the company with fine results for it is own good. For example : if the employee got some social skills , he will be able to help his company to improve in being more famous and well noun in society . Farther more, raising the name of any company by using social skills could find and  locate a superior position  better than the other rivals in the business world. 

Meanwhile , on the other hand , others are more believers in the opposite side , they consider that academic qualification is more worthy than social skills , it might  be an ability besides the first . However, companies normally need someone to do a specific job so that must be done by an expert person  depending on the requirements  such as the architect , no one else can do his work even if he got social skills .

In conclusion, after a careful analysis of both points of view, I am more agreeable with focusing on  academic abilities because being someone experienced in any speciality is harder than getting expertise in social skills . Even more , in my opinion , each company approximately will be needed to have a worker with the helpful skills of society and somebody else expert in  special academic quality."
Some employers believe that job applicants' social skills are more important than their academic qualifications.,"It is the case that a number of entrepreneurs prefer the social skills of job applicants over their academic qualifications. While I accept that social skills are significant factors those looking for jobs need to have, I would argue that their academic results are also necessary factors. 

On the one hand, it is undeniable that employer's good  social skills bring benefits to companies. It is because  most jobs require the spirit of teamwork. For example, if an employee has good skills such as listening, discussion and getting well with his colleagues, his job may get the success. Therefore, companies could earn more benefits and develop markets thanks to these efficient workers. 

On the other hand, there are some reasons why employees also need to recruit those who have high academic qualifications. When a company hire workers, they expect that the worker may handle the work productively and bring  benefits for companies. A good example is that if mechanic companies hire workers with high levels of their profession, the production system may seldom have problems, or the problem may address quickly. Moreover, the more professional workers companies have, the more savings they have. To illustrate, one person who has deep and mastery in their jobs, they can work efficiently some tasks together. As a result, employees do not pay salaries for many workers, and can save more money. 

In conclusion, from the reasons I have mentioned above, it seems to me that both job applicants' social skills and academic qualifications are the significant elements that employees should consider when they recruit the workforce for companies."
"In many countries, government spent large sum of money on the arts, and this is supported by some taxpayers as both why. Other, however, think that this money would be better spent on health and education. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","1.On January 22, 2024 Sei Rampah District Court opened the hearing by the attendance of plaintiff’s attorney, the defendant’s attorney (BSRE), co-defendant I (Ministry of Agrarian and Spatial Planning/National Land Agency), and co-defendant II (Indonesia National Land Office of North Sumatera).

"In many countries, governments spend large sums of money on the arts and this is supported by some taxpayers as worthwhile. Others, however, think that this money would be better spent on health and education. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","In most countries, Tax paying people are investing huge amounts of money and support in the arts while others think that can invest and improve human wellness and education systems. In my opinion, I believe supporting the nature of arts as well as the betterment of health and education is vital for a nation.

To begin with, there are various types of art present in this world. In fact, for some states paintings and sculptures are the backbone of their tourist attraction. In addition to that, it speaks about the architecture and literature of the nations; it also describes more about popular or everyday practices of lifestyle. However, this development gives enough observation to tourism from many parts of the globe, so this leads to one of additional income for the government. For instance, Turkey is the best place to visit; to get a dash of the middle east coupled with history and art, with the Eastern Roman Empire art museum. Thus, spending money on historical improvement will make a healthier community.

On the other hand, some people believe that there should be well-organized tuition standards and well-being systems. Indeed, ministries should have acted on improving the teaching qualities and medical structures. Moreover, local officials should arrange free campaigns to maintain wellness in society. Likewise, promoting health care services around the clock for most of the remote communities. Besides, to benefit students, provide some scholarship programs to manage their fees; also reduce the school fee in public schools to educate many rural areas. Because of those reasons, it is necessary to allocate some funds for national upgrading.  

In conclusion, it is notable to allocate money which is beneficial for both people and territory; furthermore, it gives an immense response to the ruling party and their governing management. I believe that proper spending on finances is still the best way to serve the community."
"Some believe that in many countries, the investment of public money in arts can be justified. Others think that the government should spend more on health and education. Discuss both views and give your opinion","Arts is the soul of a country’s heritage. Some people support the government investing in arts, while others prefer it to be in essential areas such as health and education. In this essay I will discuss both sides and why I believe more funding should be on the latter.

Some individuals believe there are advantages to using taxpayers' money on arts. Firstly, it can fund more activities, which include supporting museums or art gallery exhibitions such as painting, sculpture and literature. On top of that, the funding helps develop schools for performing arts and music. For example, there is hardly any art institute in Malaysia to harness young talents into becoming world-renowned artists. Furthermore, this investment helps retain the local culture and historical identity, for instance, preserving local performing arts such as Ulik Mayang in the Northern Malay Culture, since its tradition is dying with the older generation.

 

On the other hand, I believe the government should prioritize its budget for pertinent sectors like health and education. The health sector funds are essential to all citizens from infancy to the elderly as they provide the basic needs of medications, vaccines, life-saving procedures or outpatient clinics. Moreover, health education for the public is important in preventing endemic; if occurs, will be costly for the nation. In addition, investing in education increases peoples’ literacy rate and improves the economy as more intellectuals will populate the country to contribute to the GDP and income tax. This can be seen in Singapore, a country with one of the highest IQs globally, which attains the top ten GDPs in the world.

In conclusion, supporting the arts industry financially brings advantages in preserving culture and expanding new talents. However, I believe policymakers must prioritize funding in more critical areas such as health and education. After all, survival depends on basic needs, including well-being and literacy."
"Scientists tell us that some activities are good for health and others are bad. Despite knowing that, millions of people still continue doing unhealthy activities. What are the causes and what are the solutions for this?","In the cutting-edge era, modern people are regularly informed about the dangers of leading an unhealthy life. Despite the advancements in the medical field, people are still suffering from diseases that are preventable. This essay will examine the main causes of an unhealthy lifestyle and possible solutions to this problem.

One of the main causes of the problem that leads to an unhealthy lifestyle is smoking, although most people tend to smoke publically, which catches the attention of many young adults who try to imitate them by starting to smoke too. For instance, in the USA, around 57 percent of young kids do smoke by seeing strangers on the road or through commercials. Because of that, many young people put themselves in bad company. To mitigate this issue, the government should provide policy and awareness so that it may be tackled by giving positive facilities that are worthwhile of living.

Another problem is the lack of physicality. In other words, because of the advancement in day-to-day technology, most individuals get attracted to it, although it has a positive impact too. Using it constantly makes you obese and overweight due to it. Many chronic diseases, such as anxiety, pressure, and depression, get attached to your diet and make you weak mentally. For example, in 2011, the UK government issued a statement about people gaining weight due to overeating, which allowed them to put a sales tax in place to reduce the consumption of excessive eating to cope with it. Many different schemes should be provided to people to entertain them in their daily lives and create mini-tours so as to burn some calories.

To conclude, unhealthy activities have always had a negative impact on one's life and cannot be vanished. Moreover, if we deal with the iron hand, we can lessen the impact on our daily lives."
"In some countries ordinary citizens are allowed to keep a gun in their house. Some people think this is a good idea, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Nowadays, in some ,nations the use of guns has become common. People have different views on keeping weapons at home. While some assert that citizens should be allowed to keep a firearm in their homes, I personally side with those who maintain that this issue is not a good idea.

On the one hand, some hold the idea that people should be allowed to have a gun in their accommodation because the amount of crime in their society is high. In some ,countries the statistics of robbery are increasing and citizens do not feel safe as well as they have to have a handgun against such crimes for saving themselves and their family from such a potential danger. For example, last week a famous French soccer player was able to use his personal weapon to force some robbers, who had forcibly attacked his house, to run away.    

On the other hand, 2 reasons may well explain why others believe that ordinary men and women should not be permitted to keep a shotgun on their properties. Firstly, many buy a warm firearm with the excuse of protecting themselves but use it for illegal purposes. For instance, since the legalization of weapon ownership, the number of shootings in American schools has multiplied. Another example is that some people hunt  animals and birds with these weapons which have caused serious damage to the environment. Secondly, there are many gun-related injuries, or even murders in the worst-case scenario, reported every day due to a lack of enough skills while using or cleaning a handgun. 

In conclusion, although some say families must have firearms in their lodging, I strongly feel that to decrease the shooting rates and protection of living creatures, governments should not allow their nations to keep a firearm at home."
"Some people say that the increasing business and cultural contact between countries is positive development, while others think that many countries will lose their national identities as a result. Discuss both views and give your opinion","In this day and age, it is universal truth that commercial and cutural interaction has an inseperable relationship with the growth of any aspects of each country. However, whether developing it has always been a topic of general public. While a number of people argue that promoting communication between these regions may carry some  potential dangers for identity, others have a contrary-minded that it will significantly create superb results in world's connection. Personally, I contend that the benefits that globalization brings about outweighs the drawbacks.

On the one hand, it is understandable that why some groups of community believe that the interconnection between countries will take a heavy toll on the national recognition. The key rationale is that as foreign influences, especially the Western cultures that permeate other societies, more people will embrace intriguingly external ideas and start to consider that their conventional custom as obsolete, which may probably result in a loss of the national true values. However, this thinking is totally exaggerated. As far as I am concerned, instead of marginalizing the traditional values of every country, the globalization has given a larger range of chance for citizens all over the world to introduce and open their own culture to other friends. Korea perfectly exemplifies this situation. The widespread presence of entertainment companies and TV programmes, specifically the ""Hallyu wave"", has been the key to foster and promote a global appreciation towards this country. This is a testament to positive impacts of world's contact on a country's values.

On the other hand, I am of the opinion that the global development will offer stupendous advantages. In terms of business, many entrepreneurs can expand the foreign markets. As a result, many jobs are created which will directly improve people's living standards. To give a clear example, the contribution of SamSung in VietNam has hostically addressed the unemployment of a plethora of people. In addition to this, in terms of culture, the integration among these areas will mitigate many social problems which occurs on a regualr basis. To exemplify, the thinking of Western's community will gradually turn the gender inequality sentiments on Asia society's head. Therefore, it seems sensible that we can broaden our mind towards a harmonized development. 

In conclusion, while the exchange in tradition as well as trading still exist some disadvantages, it is irrefutable that the global changing has created many significant benefits for each and everyone. It is also clear that the traditional values can be separately maintained in tandem with the global integration."
"Some people say that increasing businesses and cultural contacts between countries is a positive development, while others think that many countries will lose their national identities as a result. Discuss both view and give your own opinion.","It would be argued by some that a growing international businesses and cultural exchanges can bring benefits. From my perspective, this phenomenon can cause the national specialities of many countries to be assimilated.
On the one hand, international trade can contribute to boosting the local economy. It is obviously that running businesses in other countries probably promote company’s images and reputations, hence, the information about these enterprises would be disseminated to reach more and more clients. This would help them boost their sales figures and production and commerce can be promoted. This means that these firms will dispense thousands of employment opportunities for local people, which can helps improve their living standards. In addition, a growing cross- culture can help people expand their perspectives and sense of cultural understanding by exposing to new experiences in a multicultural setting. Therefore, they will learn respect and tolerate other ethnics, which would avoid some culture- related problems such as tensions or conflicts.
On the other hand, I believe that this trend could create the possible danger of the disappearance of a cultural and traditional values of a nation. Obviously, companies would bring its own culture everywhere it goes, hence, people are more likely to be influenced and acquire a new habit. For example, many of today’s youth seem to prefer Korean songs and Chinese films rather than their traditional songs and dramatics due to the process of intergration. This means that other cultures such as lifestyles, occident costumes have gradually penetrated into people’s daily life, disregarding various time- honored values, which can cause the loss of traditional cultures.
In conclusion, there are convincing arguments both for and against developing borderless commerce and cultural contacts, but it seems to me that this trend can be considered as a insurmountable challenge in term of ever- increasing culture."
"Some people think that children should be taught at school to recycle materials and avoid waste. Other people believe that children should be taught this at home. 
 Discuss both opinions and give your own opinion.","It is very important to recycle materials and reduce the amount of waste, and teach these principles to the children, but there is a disagreement among the experts about the appropriate place for educating the children. Some believe schools are the best place for teaching the value of recycling, whereas others consider homes as the best location. This essay will discuss both points of view and I shall argue that the children should be educated about this important issue at home.

On the one hand, some believe that like most of the other learning, the value of recycling waste should also be taught at home. The process of learning for a toddler begins even before he joins a school. Because, children spend much more time at their homes and tend to follow the habits of their parents, the home is the best place to teach this important value. For instance, it is well known that babies begin to form habits during early childhood. The foundation of many good habits such as reading and self discipline is laid at home. Therefore, they argue that the education about material recycling should be given at the home.

One the other hand, I would argue that these valuable habits should be inculcated at the school. It is well established that children listen to their teachers more than the parents, and at school they also learn by observing the behaviour of their peers. Schools provide the perfect atmosphere for learning because of a formal and enabling environment. If information about the value of recycling the waste is shared in school along with a practical demonstration, the children are more likely to retain this information and practice this at their homes. For example, a recent Swedish study demonstrated that on average the students retain more information which is taught at school compared to the one provided at home. 

In conclusion, though there are convincing arguments on both sides, it is abundantly clear that because children are more likely to learn more and better in schools, they ought to be educated about this important issue in schools."
"""The shortage of housing in big cities can cause severe consequences. Only government action can solve this problem.
 
To what extent do you agree or disagree?""","With urbanisation, the population in cities is growing fast and so is the housing crisis, which brings along many other problems. Some argue that only government is the appropriate authority to deal with this rising problem. I strongly agree with this argument as governments can solve this growing issue by various steps, such as restricting new landed residential housing by encouraging vertical apartment buildings and gradually expanding cities.

First and foremost, the government is the right party to resolve this housing crisis issue by discouraging the building of new landed houses and encouraging vertical multi-storey apartment living with proper planning and infrastructure to deal with this space crunch. For example, Singapore and Hong Kong are cities on islands and they have proven to solve this crisis for their citizens by vertically building thousands of high-floor flats. These cities have proved to incorporate the best infrastructure for their ever-growing population by building multi-story apartments rather than new houses, which has resulted in economically affordable housing for their citizens in big cities. Further, to help the situation, the government can extend highways to help commuters access the cities in a country easily. This high level of planning can only be done by the government to help solve accommodation shortages for their citizenry.

Secondly, the government can help this situation by expanding cities and creating more residential properties on the outskirts of cities. In Noida, for instance, a fast-growing city in India, the housing development board has continuously helped accommodate the growing population by building more residential properties on the outskirts of the city which eventually became part of it and built metros and highways for commuters to make it easily accessible. Hence, this helped in controlling growing cramping and accommodation problems for their locals. 

In conclusion, it is clear that the government has a big role to play as an ultimate authority by taking appropriate measures to create highly planned inner-by city development and well-designed infrastructure to accommodate the growing needs of their citizens."
"You should spend about 40 minutes on this task.

More people decided to have children in their later age than in the past. Why?

Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

You should write at least 250 words.","In this cutting-edge era, numerous individuals have planned offspring in their later age as compared to the past. In my opinion, the pros of having children at later age clearly outweigh its cons.This essay will discuss both advantages and disadvantages of this trend in the subsequent paragraphs.

There are a few disadvantages of having children at the latter age. The predominant one is that older people cannot be able to take care of their children it would not be worthwhile for parents as well as for children. In the latter ,age they are not physically fit which is why they could not able to take care of their offspring.Children cannot be able to attain good education from their parents as they could not  able to do a lot of effort in their later age.

However, a number of advantages of having children in the latter age. Firstly, parents can enjoy their life which would not be possible with children . They could spend their time with each other . After , children's parents have a lot of responsibilities and they have to do more effort for making a good life for their children. without ,children they can live their life stress-free.A survey conducted by the USA demonstrated that 73% of parents have no child as they want to enjoy their life with each other.Secondly, they can focus on their career in order to get success which would not be possible after children as parents have to spend more money and effort on them. Ergo, it would be beneficial for parents if they have children in their latter age. 

In conclusion, although having children at the latter age has few demerits , it has numerous merits which are crucial to be considered."
"In some countries, people are having children at later age in life. What are the reasons? Do the advantage outweigh disadvantages?","Nowadays, there is a great discussion about whether some countries have children when they get older. Many people believe there is nothing wrong with this action, but there is a significant portion of the population who think otherwise. This essay will argue why I believe the advantages about people having children at later age outweigh disadvantages in the following paragraph.

Firstly, there are many advantages to having children at a later age. To begin with, the most important family is ready to care for the children. Some parents think kids should be born when everything is enough for them such as money, education and love. Another, the further have a child when the elder have wealth such as house and cars. This is because the family prepared everything for the children. In fact, to make them happy and enjoy being with their parents.

On the other hand, some people can argue that there are various negative effects for kids, probably of health. Which is, old parents have a child's effect damages of life for example, they possible occur a disease or obtain a fever easily than other people. However, another argument is disadvantages about social life. How to children able to be normal in everyday due to sometimes environment it was different for them, because of human have the others point of view, society community important for a child in the future to be have a friends, co-worker and couple. 

In conclusion, as I illustrated with my arguments above, I believe that everything does not have a limited scope to make it possible to make as needed. This is not to compare advantages or disadvantages but to decide by yourself."
"More people decided to have children in their later age than in the past. Why?

Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Many couples are likely to have babies later than  normal ages, which is a social norm in many countries. Although this issue may cause some drawbacks, I personally think it is more beneficial for husbands and wives to become parents when they are more mature and get ready.

On the one hand, it is evident that having children early could reduce some worries about the low rate of prenancy and the health of mothers and babies when women get older. Numerous scientists have proven that the older we become, the more difficult we have babies, especially females over thirty years old. Moreover, there is a high percentage of infants born with disabled diseases after delivery if mothers are over thirty-five years old. Therefore, many people advocate that the ideal range of ages to be pregnant is between twenty-five and thirty which would protect women from some advert events while delivering. These things might be main causes leading many families to have children when they are still young.

On the other hand, I strongly believe that a couple should have kids when they have enough financial conditions and mental health inspite of getting older. We cannot deny the importance of incomes and savings before having a new member in our family. If a couple has no stable jobs or very low-salaries, they should spend time developing their career and earning more money before becoming parents. Moreover, many persons do not prepare their spirits and consider how the life will change after a baby come which make them  confused, depressed and could not control themselves when their babies are born. As a result, the most important thing when we commit to have children is not our ages, but a sufficient preparation for everything.

In conclusion, despite some huge benefits of having babies early, it seems to me that we should prepare enough personal budgets and mental strength before welcoming our children."
"More people decided to have children in their later age than in the past. Why?

Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","The overwhelming majority of young people are inclined to marry after graduating from university or after becoming prosperous. Young adults do not have an intention in becoming parents, as they want to travel around the world and chasing after desire. I reckon this is an absolutely positive trend.

First of all, a man has children, meaning he is a homesitter; eventually, he gives up his dream and purpose, and die still alive. We all know that raising a child is an irritating job, and a huge amount of money is needed to look after a child. For example, if we observe undergraduates, they usually say, I will think about a child after empowering my financial power. Besides, youngsters' top priority is to pursue their passion now, but not to raise a kid. Hence, the population assumes adults should have a baby only after they get affluent, as raising a kid is not a game.

Secondly, one of the world's anguishing issues is overpopulation; many animals have become endangered species due to the fact that the growing numbers of humanity and human-beings depleted resources of nature. Many habitats got destroyed to feed 7 billion people. For instance, we cut down forests and destroy the ecosystem to satisfy our needs. Thus, this trend will save our planet. 

In conclusion, from the ideas and examples given, young adults have more alternatives to live compared to the old ages, so they think about to start a family after becoming wealthy or do not ever initiate. This phenomenon's virtue is immeasurable, as it will tackle one of the major problems of the world."
"Nowadays, more and more people decide to have children later in their life. What are the reasons? Do the advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?","In recent years, a noticeable shift in family planning has emerged and many people decided to have their offspring at a later stage. I believe there are numerous benefits such as they can spend quality time together and give a financially better future for their children.

One of the key reasons for the delay of parenthood is the aspiration of the couple to spend some quality time together before embarking on their future. This is because they can enjoy their life more with one another and can be able to understand each other. In this ,way the mutual understanding between them becomes stronger  and by having a better time now they can have more moments with their children later. For example, some researchers said that having more understanding before  childbirth can lead to lower chances of divorce after having babies and can take good care of them. 

Undeniably, people who concentrate more on their careers first and then have babies can give a better education and a luxurious life to their kids. Having offspring early in life can escalate the expenditures and financial responsibilities of parents. Moreover, if they do not spend more time with their children, they grow up with psychological issues. Thus, by having early offspring, young parents might put their careers and children's futures at risk. For instance, parents would be capable of enrolling their children in schools where they get quality education and learn other skills meanwhile, which are not available in all schools.

To sum up, the merits of it outweigh all the demerits because ,despite the pleasure of having new babies in the early years of marriage, parents  decide to spend better time together and provide all amenities to children and spend time with them ."
"Nowadays, more and more people decide to have children later in their life. What do you think are the reasons for this? Do the advantages of this trend outweigh the disadvantages?","During the increase of modern life, it is possible to observe that the majority of couples nowadays have decided to prorogue the decision of having babies. From my point of view, career, social changes, the cost of educating children are some of the reasons behind this trend. Also, I personally believe that the advantages of having children later in life outweigh the disadvantages.

To begin with, there are an increasing number of woman who pays attention to their career and wishes more challenge in life than only taking care of their family. Consequently, having children is no longer their priority as children demand attention and your career would need to take a back seat. Another reason is related to the costs of raising children, nowadays the needs of adolescents have changed dramatically if compared with the past. They request more goods such as high-end smartphones, travel, branded clothing and so on. Thus, wait be well financially stabilized before having babies seems to be the right decision.

On the other hand, there is some drawback for those who postpone giving birth and the first inconvenience is the difficulty of getting pregnant due to the advanced age for women, in fact, after 35 years of age the majority of woman needs some medical treatment in order to have children. Furthermore, parents who preferred having a baby at the old stage complain that they do not have the same energy and patience to play with kids as they used to have when they are younger. As a consequence, the initial idea of just fully paying attention to their children is not as they imagined.

To sum up, there main reasons that many people tend to delay having a baby in their life, and in my way of thinking the advantage outweigh the disadvantages as educating children without being financial establish brings different problems to families."
"Nowadays, more and more people decide to have children later in their life. What are the reasons? Do the advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?","In my opinion, the given statement stands partially true. Many of the married members of any family, prefer to have children at their early ages. Over the period, the decisions are changed. There could be many reasons for taking such decisions. For example, the raise in the cost of living. Due to increased prices of all the basic needs, people are finding it difficult in raising them, providing them the basic education, and taking care of them.

I believe this is the major reason behind taking such decision. Talking about the advantages and disadvantages, there is a wide scope for advantages being outweighed.

Planning for children after certain period of time, from the marriage day, it gives the couple/family a lot of time, to think about the future. Also in laying a path for their (children) lives. Parents will be able to plan according to their financial status, balancing the requirements. It given an advantage of planning their education, the best institution to chose, and also a strong support with some savings made.

Talking about the disadvantages of having children at early age, it becomes a big challenge in taking up such big responsibility. One should become more stabalized in terms of finance, and ready to spend a lot on education and other expenses.

Being a family of 5 members, with 2 siblings, I really found it very difficult for my parents in rising us. Since, they were not financially stable, and they had to make many debts for providing us all the basic needs like clothes, shelter (rented house), education fee, etc. It took them almost 20 years for them to clear all those debts. Hence I believe, and advice to the point of having children at right time, when couple are really ready to take the responsibility."
"Some people believe that it is the government’s responsibility to provide care and finance to support people after they retire. Others, however, think that individuals themselves should save money in their own when they are old. Discuss both views and give your opinion","The opinion is divided as to whether it is the role of the authorities or individuals to look after themselves at old age. While some persons argue that government have to cater for the needs of its citizens, others believe that the public should plan their retirement. This essay will discuss both views in detail followed by a reasoned conclusion. 

One of the reasons why people demand support from those in power at old age can be seen as a fundamental human right. Therefore every leader in every society has the duty to provide aid for the aged and dependent. For example, the military and civil servants gave their all during years of active service to the good of the country and it is morally justified for politicians to reciprocate by aiding the elderly. To further illustrate, some old people have challenging ailments which can only be overcome through free health care services by the government. For instance, via National Health Insurance Scheme, Nigerians are now able to seek quality health care which has improved the average life expectancy in the last decade.

Even though authorities are playing a key role, individuals need to support themselves too. Firstly, being able to save for the future reduces the national burden . This is because more money is then diverted to other lacking sectors of the economy including good roads and electricity. For example, a recent study has shown that the amount incurred by African countries in delivering free medical backing to their citizens is over 30% of the national budget leading to scarcity of funds in other sectors. Hence  gross underdeveloped was achieved. Lastly, it is important for humans to save in other to support their children too. Thus helping in the long run at securing a bright future for them as they are able to afford decent school and training thereby impacting  society positively.

In conclusion, although controversy still exists on whether the government or public should cater for their old age ,however I am of the opinion that both have a concerted effort at achieving optimal care after retirement."
"Some people think the developments of technology make people's life more complex, so we should make life simpler without using technology. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Technology has revolutionised our lives. Whereas, some people argue that instead of making lives easy, technology has made human lives difficult. In my opinion, technology has positively impacted our lives in more ways than  can be imagined but at the same time it has some drawbacks as well.

On one hand, the use of artificial intelligence and robotics has made living efficient and systematic. With these rapidly growing contemporary ,innovations it is possible to the tasks in minutes rather than spending hours on them in the office and at home as well. For instance, a simple task like cooking and cleaning used to take hours to complete, but it can now be done in minutes without putting any physical effort into it. As a result, people find more time to relax , making their lives stress-free.

On the other hand, if the automation is not used responsibly it can have negative impacts as well, especially on children. Overuse of video games, gadgets, and mobile phones can essentially destroy the kid's future. Moreover, instead of spending time  studying they spend all the time in front of the screens consequently, this affects their physical and mental well-being as well. For example, if a kid is spending hours  playing violent games, he is more likely to feel frustrated and angry than kids who spend time in healthy activities like sports and reading books.

In conclusion, where technology has numerous benefits and makes life so comfortable, it can have some serious adverse effects, if used unsupervised among children. However, if kids are supervised they can do wonders using the same technology."
"Some people think technology makes life complex, so we should make life simpler without using technology. Do you agree or disagree?","IN MODERN TIMES, THE ISSUE OF EFFECT OF TECH ON LIFE HAS BECOME HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL. THERE ARE THOSE WHO SAY THAT INNOVATIONS SHOULD AFFECT OUR LIFE , HOWEVER OTHERS BELIEVE THAT THEY SHOULD NOT.IN THIS ESSAY I WILL EXAMINE BOTH SIDES OF THE ARGUMENT AND PROVIDE MY OVERALL OPINION. 

GENERALLY SPEAKING, THERE IS A WIDE RANGE OF REASONS WHY PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT TECHNOLOGY LEAD TO BAD EFFECT ON HUMAN BEINGS. PERHAPS THE MAIN REASONS WHY PEOPLE  WHY PEOPLE THINK THAT THIS IDEA IS BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THERE ARE A FEW STORES IN THE TOWNS, PUBLİC SHOULD FIND MORE AND MORE SHOPPING CENTRES BY USING INTERNET APPLICATION SUCH AS GOOGLE, WHICH IS QUITE BIG SEARHING APPLICATION THROUGHOUT WORLDS. AS A RESULT, OUR LIFE SHOULD BE MIXED BY MEANS OF INTERNET, WHICH IS ONE FROM BID EVENTS ABOUT TECH. IF WE CONTINUE  TO USE  INTERNET IN THIS WAY, WE SHOULD BE ADDICTED HUMAN BEING IN NEXT YEARS.

DESPİTE THES ARGUMENTS THERE IS ALSO A CASE FOR THE IDEA THAT TECHNOLOGICAL EVENTS ARE IMPORTANT FOR US. PERHAPS THE MAIN REASON WHY FOLK THINK THAT THIS IDEA IS BECAUSE PHONE SHOULD BE EASLY FOR PUBLIC , ESPECIALLY CROWD LIVING IN FAR PLACES FROM NEIGHBOURHOOD. A GOOD ILLUSTRATION OF THIS THAT PUPIL GOING TO OTHER CITY FOR EDUCATION SHOULD CALL HIM OR HER FAMILY BY USING SMARTPHONE. IF WE USE TECHNOLOGY  EFFECTIVELY , OUR LIVES SHOULD BE SIMPLER THAN PAST DATES.

IN CONCLUSION, THIS IS A TOPIC WHICH IS VERY RELEVANT TO MODERN SOCIETY. DESPITE ARGUMENTS TO THE CONTRARY, I FEEL THAT TECHNOLOGICAL EVENTS SUCH AS INTERNET,TRANSPORTATION, BUILDING SHOULD LEAD TO EFFECT TO US AS GOOD.

Many students find it difficult to focus or pay attention at school nowadays. What are the reasons for this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"At the present time, most students are facing a hard time concentrating at school. It is very common to get distracted from the work or study you are involved in especially if you lack interest. Furthermore, involving in different activities at the same time also affects the level of attentiveness in an individual. This essay will discuss the above-mentioned causes in  detail and provide  feasible solutions.

Firstly, in this modern time, everyone has  access to the internet and holds their private smartphone from an early age. It's comparatively easier for a young mind to get influenced by actors, gamers, YouTubers and so on. As a result, they want to pursue the same fields, lacking interest in study which makes them difficult to pay focus on the subject matter. In addition, the children are nowadays pressured a lot to be versatile leading towards hectic day-to-day life schedule. For instance, attending different extra classes such as swimming, dancing, singing and many more from morning to evening. Hence, the children are tired and lack the proper amount of rest or sleep, for this reason, it's difficult to focus in the classrooms.

To tackle the above-mentioned problem, the parents have a crucial role to play.  , limiting their children's screen time, and access to private mobile phones only at a mature age, motivating and guiding them in the correct path protecting them from the distraction of glam lifestyles. Moreover, the children should not be forced into multiple activities that can result in futile outcomes. Helping them find their actual interest and focusing on that specific task can be beneficial to excel in that activity as well as maintaining focus in school.

In conclusion, the pressure on the student to be an all-rounder leading towards a fatigue lifestyle and influence of social media, and a lack of interest in studying are the major reasons for distraction. It can be resolved with little effort from parents."

What are the reasons for this?
What can be done to solve this problem?","Schools play an important role in the development of our brains. Nowadays a large number ofstudent feel that it is hard to concentrate and they are not able to give their full attention in school. In this essay, I will outline what is the potential reasons for this particular problem and what we can do to resolve

 this.

There is  a lot of reasons that Student are not able to concentrate in school, the major reason is 

smartphone with social media. Obviously, when these kids use Smartphones they not only watch 

videos online but also waste a lot of time on social media. As a result, they lose their concentration which hinders their close attention. for instance, a study has concluded that everyone these days has 

problem with concentration cause they are spending a lot of time in front of the mobile screen. Another reason is that nowadays these juveniles are very enthusiastic, they want to get everything in their life very early. therefore, instead of living in present with the full ,attention they waste their precious time thinking about the future.  

On the other hand, to resolve these problems public and the government both should have to perform their duties otherwise it will be a disaster for the student in future. To resolve this problem parents need to keep eye on their kids and let them know that they should not spend their precious time spending on scrolling Facebook and Instagram. government should work with these social media companies and make some restrictions on using these platforms.  

In conclusion, despite the ubiquity of mobile phones, if parents and government take stick action against social media applications they can do great care of their children and citizen."
Many students find it difficult to focus or pay attention at school nowadays. What are the reasons for this? What can be done to solve this problem,"Currently, most students have been having difficulties paying attention during classes. Although they make an effort to focus on the class it is a hard task. This essay will discuss what are probably reasons for this problem and what can be done to address it.

Firstly, with the advance of the fast-paced world, people are always very busy both in their private life and their professional life and this phenomenon happens also with school-age children. Certainly, the logic for the lack of focus and attention are both the pressure of the parents and a huge variety of activities in which graduates are submitted during the day. For instance, nowadays doing a variety of extra activities outside of the school such as dance lessons, swimming classes the young student has a life as busy as life`s adult. In addition, many parents punish their kids if they do not have a great score in the educational department how if this was the most important thing of life. Both pressures take off the attention and focus of the pupils which can lead to low academic performance.

Due to previous reasons is necessary to promote a healthy life to students once without so much pressure they will perform much better in the educational department. Therefore, parents and schools should incentive the practice of physical exercise as an alternative to outlet the stress. For example, sport is the best way to keep focal point once it teaches about discipline and behaviour. Besides, the family should not overwhelm pupils with a lot of activities. Children need to have the responsibility and duties of a child rather than having the obligation of an adult. The more pupils are overwhelmed, the less the attention on the school subjects.

In conclusion, nowadays graduates should be stimulated with pleasure activities because the pressure will minimize their attention. This essay argued about the reasons for the absence of a focal point in the lives` students and what can be done to tackle this problem."
Some people use social media to keep in touch with other people and news events. Do you think advantages of this technology outweigh the disadvantages?,"Some people use social media to keep in touch with other people and news events. Do you think the advantages of this technology outweigh the disadvantages?

In this day and age, the developments of technology on social media give a pool of opportunities for individuals to communicate with each other easily and get information about the changes worldwide.Its advantages overlap more than disadvantages and I firmly agree with this topic by stating my perspectives.

It is considerably convenient to socialize and take news involving the changes in the local areas and the world.  To be more specific , it is reasonably cheap and affordable for individuals  to talk to their family members,relatives and friends on social apps such as Telegram,Instagram and Facebook wherever they are or whenever they want. Furthermore,  modern technologies are considered crucial factors in sharing and accepting the news also the chance to become an online member of international events such as festivals, concerts etc for just a monthly fee.For instance, somebody who is in a different place from being concert can access virtually due to a pen pal for participants attending the concert .

However, there are several disadvantages that social apps may useless tools for humans. Browsing on telegram for some social purposes can cause children to become addicted the social networks.As a result, their study rate may decrease in a sensible way.

To sum up,  social media has a number of effects on human life to spend time with each other and exchange information in  daily life even though there are some disadvantages for people."
SOME PEOPLE USE SOCIAL MEDIA TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND NEWS EVENT. DO YOU THINK THE ADVANTAGES OF THIS TECHNOLOGY OUTWEIGH THE DISADVANTAGES.,"Nowadays technology is becoming more and more useful to youth. However, a certain number of people  tend to utilize social media for conversations with others and use for crucial news around the world. I believe that its advantages are overlapping its disadvantages.

There are a plethora of advantages of technology. Firstly, people can share information in a short time period as well as over long distances. To explain it more, in the modern era, if a person lives in a foreign country, family members o friends can talk with them through various apps such as Facebook, Whatsapp, Instagram, and Gmail. For instance, 80% of students use applications for different futures like video calls, and voice call because it is the cheapest way, or if they choose calling then they want to pay a big amount of money for roaming. As a result, students can save a lot of money by doing that, and utilize it on monthly expenses.

Moreover, people can get crucial news from the internet by which update themselves. To explicate, the internet has its own benefits such as the masses can see the latest news on mobile phones to compare with Television, because the news is broadcast in the evening not at a time. In addition to this, technologies are helping us in every sector. For example, in India, most machinery in Factories and Mills runs automatically by using technology setup. As a result, factory owners do not need to hire more experts for machinery.

In conclusion, individuals are more reliant on technology nowadays because it helps us in many ways like gathering via video call and getting the latest news around the world."
Some people use social media to keep in touch with other people and news events. Do you think advantage of technology outweigh the disadvantages,"This day, most people need social media to stay updated with their loved ones and other people. I positively agree with this way to communicate with others.

Nowadays, in this generation we are more in relying more on social media to have a more effective way when it comes to communicating in long-distance relationships even with our loved ones ,unlike the old ways of past generations using email or writing a letter and getting letter  email for about less than a month or worse more than a month in such action drawbacks to the misunderstanding of individuals, much worried to their family far away what her or his condition, and especially to a person who are suffering from an illness they need more emotional support. 

In addition, I am much more pro to social media since this is a new generation and it gives convenience to us. Getting accurate information about other members of the family is going through the easiest way just to call them anytime you want; it is a relief and a better practice of communicating especially for those people who can't go to their family when having a crucial event because of financial status this is the way to reach out and witness what does the real happen.

In my conclusion, in this world there are many positive effects and drawbacks when you use social media since you are the one who used to; you need more responsible on how is the proper to use  this and also know the disadvantages  such as ways you can handle it for a long time and help all of us that don't need to worry about the effects and benefits."
Some people use social media to keep in touch with other people and new events. Do you think advantages of this technology outweigh the disadvantages?,"Whether social media has more advantages or drawbacks has always been a heated discussion.Social applications has been popular these years, as with people's dependence on smart phones, ipads as well as laptops.Users in no matter ages use social apps to get in cloth with their friends and family memebers.At the same time,social media such as Youtube can always ensure that we keep in touch with the latest news.Some say that technology benefits us ,others suggests that it ruins our normal life more or less. In the upcoming paragraphs I will discuss both sides and give my own idea.

Think about the days without intelligent divices,people used telephone to communicate with each other if they got one,which cost a lot of money compared to the internet we relay on today. And if we want to get to know what happened today , we can only expect on tomorrow's newspaper and tv news lately.As for now,we can get to know what is happen now through so many live shows given by government channels or even citizens themselves,everyone can open his own channels to share their opinions and feelings .We can use lots of social media tools to share our happiness and sorrow with family members , friends or even strangers from the world.

Others may suggest that,the cons weights more than pros . Social media takes up the majority of our free time.We do not spend as much time on studying and communicating with our loved ones as before.Every now and then,it will come up news that teenagers dropped out from school because of addicted to online games .The time with online friends ruined the relationship with real family and pals . A part of internet users may even be cheated by others through onilne chatting.

From my perspective,I believe that though social media can bring us some confusion about the way we live and take up too much time that can be spent on realife,the benefits and convinence it brings have definitely ensure us to live a more better life.We use less time and money get to know the world.Consumers spent less on purchasing goods from in and abroad stores.Studens are able to learn online at home and chat with their classmates and teachers during the tough time caused by  covid-19. All in all, I suggest that social media brings the world more advantages."
Some people use social media to keep in touch with other people and news events. Do you think advantage of technology outweigh the disadvantages,"Nowadays, tracking news reports and socializing with others through social platforms has become a norm. In my opinion, there are more advantages than disadvantages of applying technology.

First of all, it is a more timely and efficient way to access news events. For instance, the journalists can publish the articles immediately despite how far they are away from the press company and update at any time later. Compared with old methods in terms of the printed newspaper, news spreading on social platforms is more broad and fast since readers from all over the globe can read or watch immediately on the internet. In addition, we are living in an era of information. As a result, everyone can access or even contribute to updating an incident.

Secondly, another benefit social media can bring is to socialize with others more effortlessly. The advent of technology allows people to keep in touch with their beloved ones regardless of their physical location and time. For example, although my friends and I are currently living in different countries, we can make comments or chat with each other at any moment once we see the posts or pictures from Instagram or Facebook posed. Furthermore, it is cost-effective and time-saving since we do not have to travel to meet up.

However, there are some drawbacks of using social media to follow the reports or interact with others. First, we still need to be cautious about the facts in the articles. Hence, the source of the report should be tested or proved to be true before being released. Also, some people who lack self-discipline may spend all their day online and get no real business done.

To conclude, I believe that the advantages of technology far more outweigh the disadvantages as long as the usage of social networks is properly managed."
Some people use social media to keep in touch with other people and news event. Do you think the advantages of this technology outweigh the disadvantages,"A certain number of people use social platform to stay connected to individuals, reports and events. I believe that the benefit of social networking outweighs the risk because it provides easy access to extensive information. However, it could also make individuals in the community less social.

 Firstly, one major demerit of social media could be less socialization amongst individuals in a society. People spend more time on their mobile devices, chatting with virtual friends and keeping tabs on their favourite celebrities. For example, my best friend who is a socialite attended a party in her neighbourhood. She noticed that people at the gathering, barely interacted with her or anyone else because they were so engrossed with their mobile phones. The party was so boring she had to leave after a few minutes. Consequently, the use of internet platforms has made socializing in the community almost non-existent. 

Secondly, I opine that the merit of internet platform could be providing easy access to information and instant connectivity to populace around the globe. A variety of social media applications such as Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp are being used by individuals daily. Moreover, they use these social media platforms to relate to people, get updates of news reports and activities that occur worldwide. This has more benefits than drawbacks. For instance, when I use my Instagram account I can keep tabs on news, various popular occasions and also interact with my family living abroad. Thus, this has made global interaction and obtaining vast information effortless.

In conclusion, I believe that the advantage of this technology by far outweigh the disadvantage because social networking makes it easy to stay connected to people as well as keeping up to date with reports and events worldwide."
Nowadays people use social media to keep in touch with others and be aware of the news. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?,"Utilizing the social webs to communicate with others and be aware of news are becoming relevant today. Despite the internet technology has helped people in connecting with their relatives and friends without the boundaries of distance and cost, also it provides all information around the world every day, but many people think that the technology has made people become less socialized and more individualistic. To a certain extent, I would agree that the internet has negatively affected to people's social life, but if we use the technology in a wise and appropriate manner, it has a lot of positive functions.
The greatest benefit from digital time is that it provides a wide range of apps to connect with people in the distance, and it creates news platform such as BBC, Bloomberg, Washington Post which is helping  to trace the situations is stemmed. Moreover, in this industrial revolution networks are being relevant among the big companies to prompting their projects. For example, we have been started supporting connection with our partners by social media since the Internet was created, and it boosts our productivity and results.  Social media not only give the chance to communicate with people abroad, but also provides all economic, politic,sport events.
On the other hand, there is always another side of a coin. The internet is believed to have detrimental side effects on the ability of people to socialise. To begin, internet at home causes the inhabitants of a city to stay at home whenever they are free. This kind of habit will cause them to lose the interpersonal skill which is crucial and should be mastered by every individual in their lives. They should, for instance, take part in youth or sports activities so that they can meet new friends and develop the socialising skill. If they do not learn how to communicate with others in face-to-face conversations, they are less likely to achieve success in their jobs which require the sophisticated communicating skills. Hence, it is clearly shown that people may eventually lose the ability of socialising if they overuse the internet.

In conclusion, the internet brings numerous advantages and disadvantages to our lives. However, I believe that we should spend our time wisely on using the internet as it can be more beneficial provided we do not overuse it and we should learn to socialise face-to-face rather than bury their heads into the screens of electronic gadgets."
"Some people believe that time spent on television, video and computer games can be valuable for children. Others beleve this may have negative effects on a child's development.

Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","In modern times, old leisure activities for children, such as sports, reading and board games 

are being replaced by a more appealing forms of entertainment, such as television, video and computer games. This has arisen countless controversies on how such a shift in leisure activities could affect children.

Firstly, it is important to recognise both the benefits and drawback that spending time on television, video and computer games can have on children. For instance, one of the benefits that children could receive from such activities is that it allows them to get better at using new technology. We are living in an age where the use of computers are more important than ever, having access to such devices through the mean of computer and video games can help children have a better understanding of how to use a computer, or even develop a special interest in the device and spark their interest in the ever-growing field of computer sciences. 

Another advantage of watching television or playing video games  is that it encourages children to stay at home. Now, this would be a good thing as it prevents their exposure to potential physical injuries from taking part in traditional physical leisure activities, or even protects them from the bad influences  other kids might pose. 

Furthermore, an advantage of watching television and playing video/computer games that would often be overlooked is the fact that it is a great form of entertainment. This ranges from meaningful and comedic cartoon shows that would give children a good laugh to many thrilling adventures in video games that would ignite their creative minds.

However, with that being said, playing video/computer games and watching television has been shown to release a high level of dopamine, a 'feel good' hormone, which is associated with the use of drugs and alcohol. Studies have shown that a sudden peak in dopamine release, would cause the body to produce drastically less dopamine afterwards, and the dopamine level could even decrease below the initial level. Leading to children feeling bored almost constantly after playing video games or watching television. Additionally, this could also lead to the body blocking dopamine receptors in an attempt to balance the hormone level, resulting in children enjoying the activities less and less, causing them to resort to indulging in more of the same activities to receive the same level of enjoyment that they did before. This is called an addiction, which would have a detrimental effect upon the mental health and physical health of children. 

Another vital drawback is that the refusal to participate in physical activities would lead to an unhealthy lifestyle, as children would prefer staying at the same place for many hours over exercising or playing sports. This together with an unhealthy diet will lead to numerous health problems, such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, once the children become an adult. In addition to that, prolonged exposure to a television or computer screen could cause children to develop vision problems. With regard to the issue of addiction, these conditions would only further deteriorate as the addiction would reinforce these behaviours in children, creating a positive feedback loop.

In conclusion, despite the many benefits that watching television and playing video games can provide children with, it is crucial to strictly monitor and regulate their time spent on these activities and maintain a balance between these and traditional leisure activities. Which allows the children to have a healthy lifestyle."
Some people believe that what children watch on television influences their behaviour. Others say that amount of time spent watching TV influences their behaviour. Discuss both views and give your opinion,"Some society believes that watching tv when you are a child influences their actions, but some individuals say that is the amount of hour a child spends watching tv. Technology is present in our lives and new generations are growing up watching tv. This essay will discuss spending longer hours watching tv and how this influence their behaviour. Overall, I believe watching tv do not influence their behaviour if their parents control how long time they watch and also what they watch. 

Some individuals believe that watching tv does not influence their behaviour, but this also can depends what type of program these children are watching. It is the responsibility of the family to control the access to programs with violence, bad vocabulary.

Currently, children are growing in this technology generation, which can impact their behaviour; for example, parents now are busy with work and sometimes can not control what their children are watching.

When children spend a long time on tv. It will impact how the child communicated and behaviour. This can lead to social anxiety, children now do not know how to socialize and develop anxiety with normal conversations. This is a problem in general, in view of all children spend a long time on tv and do not learn how to socialize, this will impact the way how those children socialize, make friends and also connections, for ,example if one individual doesn't learn was a child how to socialize, they will not have friends. In addition;will probably struggle to find a job because these individuals toneed socialize to make connections to obtain a good job. 

In conclusion, permit that kids spend a long hour watching tv can impact their act with supervision or not, the difference is that with supervision these children will not access content that's is not appropriate for their age, but still impact how to tell will interact

with other people in the future in work school and etc."
some people say that what children watch influences their behaviour. other believe the amount of time they spent on television influence their behaviour most. discuss the both views and give your opinion.,"No doubt behaviour represents the personality of an individual assignment of society believe that what children watch influence them and their behaviour while other points that the most amount of time spent on television watching influence pupils behaviour most I would like to delve both the arguments before upsurging and opinion

To begin ,with behaviour is vital for an individual in the society peoples watch a lot of things happening around them in the house and Society all things implement on the People's life and they visualise a lot of stuff in house like the body language of their parents and how their respect each other and show their love and communicate with each other pupils visualised all the things and apply and do an experiment in their own life which affect their life and behaviour and Society is also show both the positive and negative tops which people visualised all around them in the society such as road racing crime steps physical activities and all this type of visualisation affect pupils hence everything pupils visualised around them influence their behaviour

On the other ,hand watching TV influence people most in both ways positive and negative there are a lot of negative effects which affect people's behaviour like they spend a lot of time watching TV shows which affect their eyesight cause it takes a lot of concentration to watch TV and spending a lot of timing watching TV effect to take no interest in physical activities which affect their health and create health issues furthermore there are also positive effects like gaining of knowledge by the Science channel and news channels 

To conclude considering all the points mentioned above it is implicated that the visualisation of staff in society and home influence pupils behaviour and also watching TV has its benefits and bad effects."
Some people say that what children watch influences their behavior. Others believe the amount of time they spend on television influences their behavior most. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"While it is true that watching TV affects children, it is difficult to determine whether it is the content of the programs or the length of time spent watching them that has a more significant impact on children. It seems to me that although the amount of time does affect youngsters, it is the content of the programs that has a more marked influence on them. 

On the one hand, the consequences of watching TV for long periods of time can be deleterious. Firstly, the longer children are exposed to TV programs, the more likely it is for them to become addicted to watching television. When children become over-reliant on television for entertainment, they might neglect engagement in outdoor activities. This may result in a sedentary lifestyle that is highly detrimental to their physical health. More importantly, excessive TV watching impairs children’s communication abilities, so they find it hard to play or live in harmony with others. As a result, children would feel discouraged from having real interactions with people around them if they spent a huge amount of time in front of the screen, which may hinder their development of social skills. 

On the other hand, it is the broadcasted images that have the most direct effects on young viewers. Firstly, in most countries the majority of TV shows present glamorized depictions of inappropriate materials such as violence, drug abuse or casual sex, thus youngsters may adopt unhealthy habits and improper behavior. For example, they might fall under the impression that the use of alcoholic drinks is fashionable without being aware of the health risks they carry and later end up consuming these substances. Besides, in our modern consumer society, commercials also affect how children behave. Unwary young viewers could be easily swayed by captivating advertisements for junk food or video games, products whose target audience includes children, and so may pester their parents to buy these goods impulsively. 

In conclusion, although both factors have their own implications, I believe the element with more considerable impacts on children is the content. Hence, parental involvement is essential in controlling children’s TV viewing habits and in shaping a child’s values to help them enter adult life with a healthy mind."
some people say that what children watch influences their behavior. Others believe that amount of time they spend on television influences their behavior most,"While it is true that watchings TV affects children, it is hard to determine it is whether the length of watching time or the content of programs has more effects on youngsters. Although I believe that the time spent watching TV has negative impacts on young people, I think the content of programs has more marked influences on them.
On one hand, the consequences of watching TV for a long period of time are deleterious. First, The more children are exposed to TV programs, the more likely it is for them to become addicted to them. They might become more overeliant on TV for entertainment, which results in a sedentary lifestyle. Thefore, they are likely to have health risks, such as heart attack and diobety."
Some people believe that watching television is bad for children. Other people believe that watching television is educational for children. Which opinion do you agree with and why?,"From the perspective of some people, young kids can take advantage of viewing television set programmes. Others, however, hold the view that this is an unhealthy tool. I agree with the former statement to some extent, but in my opinion parents should decide which shows their children should watch.


On the one hand, there are several reasons why watching TV is beneficial for children. Firstly, video is an informative and learning tool that can broaden kids' horizons. It serves as a portal of information that can help to be more creative and familiar with the world. Secondly, television can make studying more enjoyable due to the fact that it has educational cartoons that children love to watch. For example, a recent study showed that most teachers prefer to have a computer set in their classroom to help them out in teaching. Thus, watching tv-programmes are educational for children.


On the other hand, there are also a large number of reality shows that can have a negative impact on child psychology. There are many programmes broadcasted on TV set such as violence, drugs and so on, that can be unsuitable for kids and spoil their mindset. Although watching cartoons can be beneficial and educational for them, TV viewing sometimes takes away time from reading and doing homework, which may result in low school performance. In addition, the more children watch TV, the less they exercise and the more junk food they eat. Thus, it goes without saying that television is a waste of time.


In conclusion, in spite of the fact that television programmes can be informative for kids, I believe that parents should help them to opt the right programmes."
"Some people think that employers should not care about the way their employees dress, because what matters is the quality of their work. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, there is a growing opinion that the company should not impose standards of dress on their employees. Some find this beneficial for the employees. While this may be popular among employees, introducing a dress code might be beneficial to the overall quality of work and productivity in certain industries. I tend to believe that although workers’ dress is not the primary factor in determining their quality of work, their appearance is still of the utmost importance.

First and foremost, a set of rules in wearing attire would guarantee the comfort and safety of most workers. Numerous medical and healthcare professionals are required to wear a white coat in the laboratory for convenience and safety reasons. Moreover, most workers in the construction industry must wear a uniform, including all the safety equipment, such as helmets to ensure they are comfortable and feel safe at the workplace.

Secondly, certain clothes will help to distinguish the employee from their customers or clients. Bankers or flight attendants, both need to wear uniforms to make sure they stand out from the crowds and ensure their customers know that they are currently on duty in the workplace. Another example is a nurse who needs to wear medical scrubs to make sure they are differentiated not only from patients but also from doctors.

Although indeed quality of work is important and there are some industries that do not need to set strict rules. Some professions still must use standardized apparel for employees own convenience and safety, as well as to differs them from other people in the working site.

In conclusion, I believe that companies should keep certain dress rules as long as it brings benefit to the employees such as ensuring worker comfort and safety and adding value to the overall business."
"Some people think news has no connection to people’s lives, so it is a waste of time to read news in the newspaper and watch news programs on television . To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In the digital era, News plays a vital role in People lifestlye because it is a centralised medium so humans will get the information anywhere around the world . News more interconnected to the everyone lifestyle but some people thinks knowing information through the medium it is a waste of time.In this essay i will discuss the benefits of learning the news.

Firstly, last decades most people reading news in the  newspaper beause it will help to know current level of their society and it is contain all the information like health,business more entertaiment blocks.Apart from that reading paper in the morning gives relaxation to their minds and reduce their stress.For example, During tsunami people knows the whether information through Television and papers.

Secondly, Nowadays technology developing so we have to know what is happening to the outside world so reading news will help to improve people knowledge vice versa.All of us need to update so we need some medium know around the world so television news live helps to  watch the incident directly .For example, During the  covid 2021 people follow the news channel to get rid of the discease and  follow government instruction.

Finally, News and the medium helps to people for learning and knowing current status of the world and it has more like job opportunties and entertainment without this we could not live happily and peacefully so people update their knowledge through news medium."
"Some people think news has no connection to people's lives, so it is a waste of time to read the news in newspapers and watch television news programs. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","These days, people sometimes argue that it is time-consuming to read newspapers or watch news programs because news is not associated with their lives. Personally, I completely disagree with this view due to several long-term benefits news brings to us.

There are a number of reasons why I approve of this. The most frequently cited one relates to the strong relationship between individuals and the community. Apparently, the news presented on such means of mass media has a great impact on our lives. These are the current affairs that residents need to notice and take concern, from several local information such as education and lack of clean water to a variety of global issues, which are climate change or ozone depletion. Each one plays a significant role and we cannot deny their benefits to bring us a wide range of knowledge about the wider world.

Secondly, it seems evident that news is an enormous source of information with  value  for citizens to anticipate and well prepare for their future. There are those who always keep up with the latest news and are ingenious  so that they can recognise the tendency of society to develop their own advantages. Furthermore, the news is a crucial need owing to its positive purposes. For example, good news may bring about a good sense of confidence and belief, while  bad ones may warn us about the barriers we have to tackle. As a consequence, we can find the most effective method to encounter these obstacles.

In conclusion, for the reasons I have mentioned above, I believe that news has various merits in people’s lives, which are a useful source of information and the intimate knowledge we can learn from it."
"Some people think the news has no connection to people's lives, so then it is a waste of time to read the news in the newspaper and watch television news programs. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Approaching modern lifestyles where everyone finds ascertain phenomenon around disinformation on social media platforms. Whereas grabbing intentional focuses on accommodative fields, their direction opinions about the spare present can increase anxiety. In this thesis, I strongly agree with the opposite daily broadcast toward gain acknowledged on several global occurrences. 

Foremost recent broadcast beginning overwatched articles which must be qualified time consumptions. However, this ciscrumstate against misunderstanding of collective society for every reader. Firstly, online channels have imposed commonplace issues that outweigh repetitive produces. One of the most significant aspects of the next generation retains meaningful interests in cultural perspectives. For instance, CNBC data with detailed content following the victim's complaint discovery. Therefore, information channels are doing a range of creativity to navigate outsource critics aim understandable and ambitious media combinations.

Secondly, there is an effective division of economic crease and extending diverse cultures becoming aggressively progress. Numerous residents, especially young adults who have wasted seconds on social media outperform ignoring national conflicts. Hence, they are a lack of responsive conversations about globalization problems and also documentary journals. Additionally, this wrong behaviour will integrate serious issues over the next ages. For instance, gun enforcement is differently applied in U.S states, where homicide criminals must be sued over the internet and television. Consequence occurrences have shown in public to be aware hazard crimes are from surrounding places. 

To summarize, spending a particular hour in a day watching administrative information is building cultural correlations. Additionally, assisting common ethical analysis of whether an individual participates in society."
"In some cities people are choosing cars instead of bicycles, while in other cities riding bikes is replacing cars. why is this the case? which development do you think this better?","Air pollution in big cities has become a big problem nowadays, because many diseases are caused by air pollution. In this essay, I want to tell in what way we can solve this global problem.

        One of the important causes of air pollution incineration of waste in factories.the smoke from burning waste causes great harm to the environment. Therefore, the emissions from vehicles such as cars, buses and motorcycles, have a big  effect on the atmosphere.Another factor that is determined widely is the development of oil production.Toxic gases from oil refineries cause black clouds in the lower atmosphere, which directly affect people's lifestyles. This problem has been developing in recent years in large cities with high oil demand. In addition, many people are throwing rubbish in the street, which causes little damage to the atmosphere.

         

In order to solve these problems caused by the factors mentioned above, there are some following beneficial solutions. Firstly, the government should have a resumption of oil refineries than usual strategies to reduce private transportation types such as motorbikes, cars by developing public vehicles and using green energy sources to oil factories energy sources in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.Secondly, implementation of tree plantation projects in big cities is also an important and necessary solution to refresh the atmosphere.

In conclusion, air pollution is still  currently a serious problem in many big cities throughout the world and this problem is caused by different factors but most of the causes for this are from people"
"In some cities people are choosing cars instead of bicycles, while in other cities riding bikes are replacing cars. Why is this the case? Which development do you think is better?","It is believed by some people that driving vehicles are the first choice when they go out. Others, on the contrary, think that riding bicycles are prioritised. This essay will introduce reasons of the trend and give my opinions.
Travelling by bikes have two advantages.Firstly,it is good for our health. The bicycle is an environment-friendly transportation as it never needs fuel, which causes no pollutants in the air. As the result, the risk of several diseases may be decreased. Secondly, Riding bicycles will save time in short distance route. There are always a large number of vehicles on the roads, especially during the rush hours in the big cities such as New York and Beijing. Instead of driving cars, riding bikes significantly reduce the traffic congestion and help residents save a lot of time in commuting.
It is also reasonable as why cars are popular in some cities. It is widely known that driving is more efficient, particularly in long distance journey. Nowadays, more and more people would like to broaden views and explore new things by tourism. Comparing with the bikes, cars which do not require a lot of energy from travellers and are much faster can save a lot of time and give explorers more opportunities to views more places and scenery. 
In conclusion, in my mind, both approaches have their own pros and cons. There is no good or bad choice, It all depends on personal preference. Cycling can not only curb the carbon emissions but also help people in keeping both physical and mental health. Meanwhile, cars, in developing countries, can give people higher social status and provide a more efficient way for people to achieve the destination."
"Some people think that the government should provide assistance to
all kinds of artists including painters, musicians and poets etc.
However, other people think that it is a waste of money. Discuss both
views and give your opinion.","Nowadays government is providing many facilities to their people. There are some people who think that government has to provide support to the struggling artists like painter, singer and poets. While others believe that if government give assistance to those artists then it is nothing but just a waste of money, This essay will discuss why it is completely important to support this type of artists.
On the one hand, some people think that artist like painters, musician and poet should not be supported by government. They have reason to believe that, providing fun for this artist is the waste of money, instead of doing hard work to grow stronger this artist are wasting their money on alcohol. For example, one of my friends who is a singer and whenever he got aid from the authorities he went to the nearest bar and drinks the alcohol by that money. Because of this reason, people disagree with the statement that to support artists.
On the other hand, people who are in favour of that the government should provide help to the artist to build their career. They believe that some artists are poor and they don't have anything to feed their family. They just have their talent and in that case people believe that government should provide financial support for these types of artists. For instance, my neighbour uncle is a great painter, but he is poor and if they get the help of government then he could show their talent and can earn some money to teach their children. It is the reason that makes some people believe that artist should be helped by the government.
In conclusion, whether artists should be supported by government is becoming debatable. Some people who think that if artist are Supported by government could make us proud, while others disagree. In my opinion, government should assist the artist who is poor and needy and in that way the money won't be wasted."
"The best way to reduce poverty in developing countries is by giving up to six years of free education so that they can at least read, write, and use numbers. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is often argued that the best method to alleviate poverty is giving all children in underdeveloped countries a chance to learn and pursue their studies in six years without any fee. In my opinion, I completely agree with this method as it increases the chance of a child's potential to reach its fullest and fend off illiteracy.

First, giving out a chance to study, not only supports many families who are struggling with low income but also encourages many young children to participate in academic choices. Second, with the help of understanding the national language, basic equations and some life skills like using fire extinguishers or how to perform CPR can help an individual life more opportunities to find a job to help their family. For instance, if a child is equipped with basic knowledge not only they can understand life choices and being independent, but they can also determine their career choice more easily. 

Moreover, this act could lessen the jobless rate and make people more confident with and have a variety of options for careers to choose from. This policy could fill out the needed employees in the workforce that many recruiters and organizationscareers are seeking, with the workforce expansion more international markets will be interested in investing and offering scholarship programs for more qualified workers. For example, in the past, the Japanese used to struggle with poverty and illiteracy, which consequently led to an era full of jobless people.

In the end, erudition is the main currency that each individual should have. Without it or any cognitive skill, it could be detrimental to a whole society. linking word Implementing legislation on free education could help raise the country's economy to its prime."
More and more people are becoming seriously overweight. Some people suggest that the solution to this problem is to increase the price of  fattening foods. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"An increasing number of people are becoming crucial too fat. There are controversies recommended to solve this problem with thriving food. In my opinion, I disagree, because to solve this problem people need a total change our eating habits and exercise regularly.

The solutions for this problem need a total change in all of our eating habits. We should revise the contents of all of our daily foods and ensure that it provides us with all the basic nutrients and all of our heath-requirements for example, fruits, vegetables, milk, fish, meat. 

 Moreover, we should add the exercise to our daily routine, as the doctor recommend that we should practice walking daily for a minimum of 10 minutes. Also, we should implement this concept in our new generation to raise a good healthy family. The governments should  have a great role on this by organising a campaign that would advertise for a healthy lifestyle and offer places for free walking and a sports centre at a low cost.

In conclusion, obesity would always be a common heath issue unless we change our lifestyle in terms of healthy and balanced diet and good physical exercise."
Large companies use sports events to promote their products. Some people think it has a negative impact on sports. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, advertisements are becoming more and more omnipresent in human’s daily life. While some big companies have proclivity to use sports as schemes for advertising, certain people consider it as an obstacle for sports. In my opinion, the demerits are overshadowed by the merits in this trend.

To begin with, it is persuasive for some people to consider this trend as an obstacle for the sports industry. To be more specific, sports, for some extent, are believed to better not be industrialized. Given that it is a kind of entertainment, a plethora of people argue it should not be used as a kind of commercialization which can be a nuisance for them. However, in these days and ages, this thinking is out of the trend and inappropriate, in particular, numerous athletes and sport stars are making a living from commercials. Thus, stopping sport advertisements means income reduction for various people working in both marketing and sport fields.

On the other hand, I strongly believe sports events from companies’ advertisements bring various positive impacts. First of all, commercials are such a favourable way for boosting sportsmanship. The more advertisements related to sports, the more opportunities are given for residents to come across and play it, facilitating sports spirit promotion. Therefore, not only profits but also spiritual life are enriched through schemes. Additionally, advertising using sports means that companies are also indirectly running commercials for the sports industry. Thereby, this field can gain a striking income from individuals or personal companies, serving for investment in sports such as gear, events or competitions. For instance, the national soccer team in Viet Nam can achieve lots of financial support after each match, helping so much for their career. 

In conclusion, advertisement is one of the optimal ways for swaying customers’ opinions. Thus, everyone should have a joint effort to make it a good way of popularising sports, leading to positive impacts on human’s life."
"Some people think that newspapers are the best way to get news. However, others believe that they can get news better through another media platform. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","In today's information age, the source of news dissemination is a matter of continuous debate. While some argue that newspapers remain the paramount medium for news consumption, others contend that alternative media platforms are superior. This essay will explore both perspectives and provide a personal viewpoint.

Supporters of newspapers as the premier news source assert that they offer in-depth, well-researched content, making them a reliable choice for news enthusiasts. The print medium is often associated with credibility, as established newspapers adhere to rigorous editorial standards. For many, the tactile experience of reading a newspaper remains unmatched.

However, those who favor other media platforms argue that the digital era has reshaped news consumption. Online news websites, social media, and news apps deliver real-time updates, enabling readers to stay current with the latest developments. Additionally, these platforms often incorporate multimedia elements like videos and interactive graphics, enhancing the overall news experience.

In my opinion, while newspapers have a storied history and continue to offer quality journalism, the convenience, immediacy, and multimedia features of digital media make them the superior choice. Online news platforms provide news-seekers with diverse perspectives and allow them to engage in discussions and share opinions, fostering a more comprehensive understanding of current events. Furthermore, the customizable nature of online news allows readers to filter information according to their interests.

In conclusion, the shift from traditional newspapers to digital media platforms is a natural progression in today's fast-paced world. While newspapers have their merits, the dynamism and accessibility of alternative media platforms make them a more effective means of news consumption."
Young people are often influenced in their behaviours and situations by others in the same age. This is called “peer pressure”. Do the disadvantages of peer pressure outweigh the advantages?,"In modern society , associated stress become an increasingly  important issue with students or those who are studying and working . They are compared and influenced by people of the same site, same ability or location, the same group in society is believed to be more successful. This situation does indeed cause certain negative effects, but in my view, they will be overshadowed by an optimistic side .

There are many reasons why associate stress is not a very positive thing . Depending on each person's age and personality, associate stress also manifests itself differently. Expressions of associated stress can be positive or negative. With regard to the negative side , stress and influence from our peers cause us to conform as a way to fit into the social group and our family . The stress from the comparison of our scores at school makes us feel depressed and prone to failure.

 Additionally , leads to depression, always feeling anxious and pressured when around excellent people . Because we want to show that we are not inferior to others and easily agitated when provoked by someone . Due to the imposed expectations from society and those around them losing self-confidence and self-esteem when having to race after others with a different frame of reference . 

Meanwhile , It is beneficial for individuals when colleagues or friends encourage them to do something positive or push them to grow.

 Another key is healthy competition will help them be more motivated to act and achieve the desired results . It brings motivates us to study harder, achieve higher scores, and progress at work

. That can be a role model for us to strive and improve and there is a saying that is often used in business: ""No pressure, no diamonds"". This means that the strain from the success of those around you makes you work harder and try harder to become a person like your friends.

In conclusion , any problem usually has both positive and negative sides, this depends on how we ourselves perceive and solve it. associate strength can be the push that creates the motivation to push you higher, but at the same time, it can also push you down to the abyss of despair."
"Young people are often influenced in their behaviours and situations by others in the same age. This is called ""peer pressure"". Do the disadvantages of peer pressure outweigh the advantages.","It is an undeniable truth that youngsters are encouraged by their friends, parents and teachers, however, they are more influenced by their friends because of their similar ages and understandings.This phenomenon has both pros and cons which I will discuss in this further essay.

There are myriad advantages of such influence. To initiate with, the knowledge and experience they gain by each others company. To explain it more I would say that, every child needs someone with whom they can share their happiness and sorrows and if, they are their friends they feel more comfortable with them to share anything.Moreover, They can learn an important life skill by encouraging each others like, good communication skills and leadership skills and this helps them in sorting out many difficulties in their life.

Despite having many Benefits of peer pressure, it has some limitations too.To begin with the adoption of bad habits, If any young  child is influenced by the person of his age who smoke and drink, they may also involve in that bad habit. Furthermore, Inspiring wealthy people also creates inequality in a person's life.For instance, if youngsters are encouraged by rich people there may be a chance that they demand for the expensive gifts from their parents, which they could not afford.

To conclude and give my opinion, I would say that, encouragement always provides a platform to do something challenging and interesting and as similar to this if young ones follow others positively it will help them more to grow well."
"Some people think that employers should not care about the way their employees dress, because what matters is the quality of their work. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In the modern society, people’s work clothes have attracted much concern.Some people hold the view that the style of the staff should not be paid attention to by the manager on the grounds that the work productivity is of importance. Personally, I believe the way they dress completely depends on the type of their company or job.
On the one hand, formal clothes are suitable for profesional jobs as well as in disciplined settings. Several certain jobs such as lawyer, doctor, teacher and even sales people require people dress up smartly and courteously which undoutedly boost confidence and work efficiency.For example, when wearing white blouse in the hospital, doctors may be more aware of the value of their work in order to try their best to fulfill their duty. Futhermore, should they wear smart clothes, they will be respectful towards others, which affects social interaction and be enormously significant to those face-to-face jobs, especially marketing or receptionist.
On the other hand, there are remarkable reasons why a multitude of individuals  hold the notion that using formal clothes is unnecessary. First of all, clothings are not reflective of the worker’s own performance or their ability. For instance, technological company like Google and Facebook are well-known for their relaxed dress codes because they aim to create an informal, exciting and creative environment; consequently, they produce sophisticated and convenient products despite casual clothes. Secondly, informal clothes are oustanding choices for not only sedentary work styles but also active employess. Loose clothes help relax their muscles, bring comfort and their actions will not be limited.
In conclusion, although clothing does not reflex one’s ability to work, the style of people should be appropriate for their jobs. While in professional setting formal clothes increase people’s self-confidence together with the work productivity and show respect to other people, casual clothes make the staff relaxed and also be convenient for moving employees."
"Some people think that employers should not care about the way their
employees dress, because what matters is the quality of their work. To what
extent do you agree or disagree?","It is often said that the uniform of the workers should not be taken in the priorities of any corporation as the quality of the work is not dependent on what the employees wear. I partly go with this view for some reason.

It is clear to be seen that people, who take the side of the dresses do not affect the quality of the work, have some claims. Firstly, the pursuit of excellence in the career is actually apart from the clothes that you possessor your outer appearance in your work area. Secondly, enforcing one uniform on the employees does not have the same crucial issue as the work environment, boss' concern, and financial return. Finally, wearing the same clothes can not fit all people because people's opinions about their own requirements such as clothes and food are significantly different according to their culture, customs, and their comfort. 

On the other hand, the opposite opinions see that wearing the same uniform can assure the spirit of loyalty and cooperation between the members of the staff. Furthermore, the difference in financial level between the partners can reflect on their wearing so that some of them may feel that they are lower than their counterparts. Accordingly, the obligation of the uniform of the members of the same company can heal the circumstances stemming from the differential of their social class.

In conclusion, although there are some considerable drawbacks of making people free to wear what they want in their work, I agree that we do not give the greatest interest to employees' appearance."
"Newspapers have influenced people's idea and opinions.

What are the reason for this?

Is this a positive or a nagative devlopment?","In recent times number of individuals who are effected by media has surged. Although it brings about more problems than it solves, it may prove to be a mixed blessing.

As we live in the age of internet the availablity of the news in both physical and online style is growing, which has led to an increase in number of people who are influenced by them. Newspapers are alleged to play a vital role in human's thinking style, especially among the elderly, which is true. This matter has occured by policy makers, specifically in tyranical regimes, to shape people's thinking and lifestyle. On the other hand, it is economically beneficial for the shareholders of newspapers so they do anything in order to have a more charming newspaper. It is just half of the picture; this matter needs to be seen on a broader canvas.

While there are both merits and demerits on this issue. Media has the power to shape our mind and force the community to think and behave the same. Moreover, Media can make us believe what it wants to which is a serious matter.  Because of these drawbacks some people deciede not to read newspapers and magazines but a smart reader should read various number of them and then choose whether they are fake news or not which is too optimistic to become practical.

In conclusion, the effectivness of newspapers are inevitable and they are an inseprable part of our life. The disadvantages of this problem far outweigh its advantages."
Newspapers have influence on people’s ideas and opinions. What are the reasons? Is it negative or positive development?,"It is admittedly true that the newspaper plays a vital role in people's thought process and helps to make a decision. In my opinion, it has pros and cons as the newspaper does provide us with  daily basis public awareness. In this essay, I am going to examine this question from my point of view and give relevant examples.

On the one hand,the newspaper is a way of passing information about what is happening in the world in recent times,which can be used as a guide to take preventive actions needed. For instance, all relevant information provided is getting published daily in the newspaper in covid-19 time to people how they should awareness of covid-19.

Furthermore, the newspaper also provides health information about covid how individuals prevent it and if they attack by covid then what should they do. These can be some of the many benefits of reading newspapers.

On the other hand, some newspaper publishers promote unnecessary news which attracts people but it is only done for grabbing the reader's attention. For a successful example,recently a Bangladeshi newspaper publisher The Prothom Alo who have published  news about the famous actor arifin nessu’s affair, which is attractive news for arifin neesu’s fanbase but the news was totally misinformation(from Arifen Neesu Facebook post). The newspaper publisher can promote positive news such as health, law,environment so on.

To sum up, the newspaper plays an essential role in people's life for their news but sometimes they promote negative news which  affect people's livelihoods."
newspapers have a significant influence on people's ideas and opinions. Why is this happening? Is it a positive or a negative situation?,"In the recent time, the newspaper which is one of the most common source of information can really has affection on people's mind. Many people discuss the positive and negative influence of newspaper. With providing knowledge and official information, I think the positive outweighs the negative.

In the one hand, many people said that newspapers negatively affect people and there are several reasons for this opinion. Firstly, many unethical newspapers post news which has wrong facts and information. For example, a story has many aspects to look at, but bad newspapers choose drama way to attract more readers. This makes people see a story in the wrong way and sometimes affects people who are in the story. Finally, newspapers can manipulate readers. For instance, newspapers can be used as a tool for government to manipulate society. This makes people do wrong things because their single source of truth provide manipulated information.

In the other hand, newspapers have many positive aspects such as providing knowledge and information to people and correct misunderstanding information. Firstly, we can not deny that newspapers provide a lot of information and knowledge. For example, newspapers update not only local news but also international one. People can gain knowledge and open their mind just by reading newspapers. Finally, newspapers help correct misunderstanding information. For instance, there is a lot of wrong information and newspapers have responsibility to provide official one. This helps people avoid misunderstanding information and have better point of view.

In conclusion, affection of newspaper on people's mind are both negative and positive. But personally, with providing official information and help society have correct ideas, I think the positive outweighs the negative."
Newspapers ahve influenced people's ideas and opinions. What are the reasons for this? Is this a positive or a negative situation?,"Newspapers have an impact on the thoughts of humans and may lead them to change their ideas. This essay will discuss the causes ,especially on the elderly, and it will argue if it has pros or cons effect. 

The main purpose why journals affect the thinking of the community is that the topics are usually written by journalists and reporters. In other words, these writers have the expertise in a specific domains and will provide  detailed and true info. Moreover, the published reports are based on evidence, which will provide the reader with the explanations needed. To elucidate, I read the reports of scientific studies in Physio Pedia, which is a medical Journal for the physiotherapist without searching for  references. Thus, papers impact the opinions of the persons.

From my point of view, I believe that this is a positive situation as it gives the community the basic data without the need of surfing the websites and the books in order to know the news. This means, it facilitates people’s life and consumes less time in order to know the information. Furthermore, each person can elaborate their own ideas in the field specified for their study and work. For instance, TV5 press hires each reporter in their field of research during their academic years of study. Therefore, in my opinion, this is a positive situation. 

To conclude, the press has an impact on people’s thoughts and opinions since it is provided by journalists and experts. This is a positive case since it gives the reader the needed information without doing big research."
Newspapers have influenced people's ideas and opinions. What are the reasons for this? Is this a positive or a negative situation? the reasons for this? Is this a positive or a negative situation?,"In the past decades, newspapers were the major medium to flash the news, events and happening throughout the world. What is going on, the community came to know from journals in the majority. It has influenced people's lives in various aspects. Up to a large , ,extent it has transformed the thoughts of the masses towards growth and this essay is going to express the reasons behind this in the upcoming paragraphs.

Even though  technology has taken a seat in print media through various visual platforms, the importance of magazines never faded away. It is the only era when the crowd became able to gain news ,not of local areas, however, also about international activities too. It's the paper due to which an awareness came into the limelight among the population and accordingly the changes in societal opinions could see productively. society came to know about the working strategy of governments. They became more idealistic towards the decisions made by the authorities for the development of the country and the welfare of their public. Moreover, they seemed more confident to raise voices against the unlawful activities of governments and other unethical groups. 

In terms of education, tabloids have a great impact on the reading content which has further improved the writing and reading skills of folk as the masses came to know about various vocabulary words in routine and the sentence structure, especially, when they tried to read newspaper of non-native languages. For example, during the British rule in India , communities who were little educated and had limited access to English Institutions to learn other languages such as English had only flourished their linguistic skills through newspapers. Even in the present era, where  television and other social platform are available to gain information about various activities. Newspapers are still there in the market and are highly opted not only by a common man but, also by distinct organisations, institutions. Also, it is the major source to advertise the content officially and to promote business.

In the end, it is numerous upsides which have been helping people to transform their viewpoints into reality and hoping for its further existence as it is not just of the news also to enhances a lot of ideas, opinions and language skills."
"As housing is a basic need for people, the government should provide free housing for everyone who cannot afford it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Poverty is becoming a major issue all over the globe. However, accommodation is a basic necessity of the masses. I do not agree with that notion because governments should give free houses to needy people as it would be a practical solution for the homeless.

That is not deniable that there are a plethora of reasons why governments help poor people. To explain it more, in many countries, governments introduce a housing sahay yojna by which needy people meet their requirements. For example, the Government of India made 20,000 apartments every year for those who cannot afford it due to which, needy people can buy them easily and live a peaceful life.

On the other hand, If a government started providing houses to all individuals, it would be affected the economy. It is not possible to make millions of houses at the expense of the government. Government has too many other works for a nation such as providing equipment for defence, giving workers salaries, and many others. They also have to give that money to health care, and basic education and maintain other infrastructure of the country by which people can be educated ad not rely on anyone.

Moreover, in every country, people choose to free things rather than work harder. To explain it, If authorities provide a free home scheme, the masses stop working hard tempted to meet House. For instance, BBC News revealed that 20% of Americans do not want to do the job because they get two-time meals from the government. Hence, the unemployment rate is increased compared with the past in the USA.

In conclusion, although the home scheme is beneficial with several terms such as low-budget houses, it is not possible for millions of citizens in the country."
"As housing is a basic need for people, the government should provide free housing for everyone who can’t afford it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, the cost of homes is increasing at an alarming rate. The apartments are a  basic necessity for individuals, the governments should give free accommodation for each and everyone who can not bear it. Personally, I completely agree with this standpoint because it benefits both individuals and society as a whole.

Although if everyone owns a house, people have more money to spend on other things. Thus, they will buy new clothes, increase  disposable income and they will spend on luxurious items but in fact, the population will change the product more often than in their life. The result of higher spending would lead to inflation in the economy.

But we must observe realistically that the government collects taxes from the citizens of the country. So the responsibility lies in officials to take care of the individuals who have been living and working in these countries and make sure nobody is left homeless. They should build  new buildings to accommodate people who cannot afford such  expensive properties. When they do that, there will be a lot of benefits. For example, this will help to reduce poverty  in the country because instead of spending an enormous amount of money to buy a house , they can use this money for their life to get food. Furthermore, decreasing the crime rate since the poor will do anything to steal valuable things that they are not able to afford.

 In conclusion, with the aforementioned, I totally agree with the idea to build a free house for people who can not afford it is applicable  because of  the benefits it brings."
Young people are often influenced in their behaviors and situations by others in the same age. This is called “peer pressure”. Do the disadvantages of peer pressure outweigh the advantages?,"Peer pressure has evolved as a majority topic of a concern in modern society. While I accept that this phenomenon is advantageous in a few ways. I firmly believe that its drawbacks are significant.

I agree that there are some benefits of peer pressure. The most obvious benefit is that peer pressure helps motivate young people to feel like they should try harder to become better. For example, in academic achievement, peer pressure makes young people realize they have to study harder and put in more effort to keep up with their peers. Without a sense of competition, it can be difficult to let the most brilliant and diligent students in a class shine. One more clear benefit to consider is that peers who are kind-hearted and optimistic can influence others to build these qualities in themselves. Peer pressure can encourage positive behaviors such as healthy habits, and volunteering.

However, I am strongly of the opinion that the disadvantages of peer pressure  are more significant. The primary negative of influenced by others is that peer pressure makes them feel isolated if they are incompetent and not on the same level as their friends around them.

For example, if this happens in the classroom, students affected by this feeling will become mentally unstable, feeling scared, autistic, and unable to communicate with anyone. Futhermore, young people are drawn into age-inappropriate behaviours such as drinking alcohol and smoking and then dropping out of school, even taking drugs when they feel bored with life.

In conclusion, peer pressure makes youth worse off. It is clear that these consequences are greater than the benefits of peer pressure, so young people need to be aware of its effects and ignore judge and the bad behaviours of others."
"In some countries, celebrities complain about the way the media publicize their private lives. Some people say that they should accept it as part of their fame. Do you agree?","Nowadays, the development of media technology has brought us plenty of entertainment. Some famous people blame about paparazzi for hunting them. While some argue it is right. Personally, I can only agree partly with the issues and this essay will explore more about the above problems.

 

First, we will discuss the negatives. Standing in the people's perspective who witnessed tragedies when their beloved members are depressed causes affected by netizens. In fact, plenty of famous individuals have been affected by mental issues so badly by negative words on the Internet. For instance, in recent years, some miss or models who are not careful in their words, do not receive  the support of everybody. In addition, a multitude of netizens blamed her, which made her become depressed and even get crowd syndromes. 

On the other hand, we will discuss the positives. Standing in the perspective of celebrities who were paparazzi welcome and hunting them, they feel very happy and looking forward to that .This can be seen, in plenty of famous people who are very happy when someone talks about them which helps them viral more and more. For example, a multitude of celebrities have over or viral behaviours on the internet. They are so happy when the population talks about them. Moreover, they can make a lot of income from this fame. 

In conclusion, the hunting of paparazzi is positive or negative it depends on the perspective of each individual. We should have the right choices when reading news about them. That goes hand in hand, with the government should have sustainable, suitable policies that have the purpose of creating a society better and better."
"In some countries, celebrities complain about the way the media publicize their private lives. Some people say that they should accept it as part of their fame. Do you agree or disagree?","These days, the media intrusion of celebrities’ privacy is becoming more popular in some parts of the world. It is argued by some that famous people have to embrace this trend as a price for their fame. However, in my opinion, I totally disagree with this view on account of some reasons below.

There are many reasons why I strongly believe that it is unjustifiable for the private lives of well-known people to be widely publicized through means of mass media. First of all, the privacy of personal information should be respected as a human right regardless of who they are. Celebrities are also humans, and they should have their own life or their own freedom. Secondly, when the private lives of influential people appear on social media, this can somehow cause some controversy among some groups of people. In fact, some anti-fans or uncivil people can unconsciously post some negative comments which make loyal fans become angry. This would be worse if those people have heated debates and intentional insulation, which leads to utter chaos in society to some extent.

Some people hold an argument that the loss of privacy is an unavoidable part of becoming a famous celebrity. This is because human beings are undoubtedly a curious species, and headlines about well-known stars’ private lives can catch the attention of many viewers, making the publicity of celebrities become greater at the same time. Having said that, I still argue that the personal lives of famous people should not be published in the media due to tremendous negative effects on their mental health. To be more specific, being famous stars can be pressured and stressful since they always have to worry about others’ opinions or be careful in every action when the paparazzi can follow them at any time. For instance, many K-pop stars cannot put up with criticism of Internet users when their private lives are reported on articles, leading them to depression or even suicide.

In conclusion, because of the aforementioned reasons  in terms of human rights and detrimental effects on celebrities’ mental well-being in particular and society in general, I disagree with the view that famous people should accept privacy invasion as a part of their reputation."
"Schools should focus on academic success and passing examinations. Skills such ad cookery, dressmaking and woodwork should not be taught at school as it is better to learn these from family and friends. To extent do you agree or disagree.","These days, schools shouldn't taught the students about any skills they only should taught them the academic success and passing examination. So, some people agree with that idea. while, others disagree with that. In this essay i will discuss both sides and i will draw my personal conclusion.

On the one hand, if i agree with that i have some reasons. First of all, the family and friends should do that to make a strong relationship because they will spend over times together. Moreover, they will feel comfortable when they do the skills such as cookery, dressmaking and woodwork because they will do that in some place they love it instead of school. Although, they will be exciting to finish that because they work with people they love them besides, they will have a lot of momert to remember in future.

On the other hand, also if i disagree with that idea i have a lot of reasons. First, definitely school should focus on academic success and passing examinations but also they should make class for student to learn some skills, if they do that the student will love go to school. In addition, the teachers will have more experience about skills such as cookery, dressmaking and woodwork than family and friends and that will help the students to learn faster. However, the students spend may be 6-7 hoursin per day in school and that making them feel boring but if they practice some skills they will feel great and don't prefer about time they spend it there.

In conclusion, after analysis both view, I believe that the both of family and school should taught the student the different skills. Moreover, i agree with tgat because the students spend half the day in school also in home and that helping them to practice very well the skills. Although, i think also the government should make class for the teachers and parents how they teach the students about cookery or dreemaking and woodworks. Also, that great for economy will be higher because all people will join there."
"Schools should focus on academic success and passing examinations. Skills such as cookery, dressmaking and woodwork should not be taught at school as it is better to learn these from family and friends. To that extent do you agree or disagree.","Numerous people have argued that school should teach a lot of skills in daily life such as cooking, dressmaking, or woodwork, not only focus on academic achievement as well as examinations. In this essay, I will explain why I tend to agree with this statement. 

On the one hand, learning essential subjects like math, biology, and language is most likely the main purpose of every school in this entire world, yet the hope of parents. Based on the statement by UNDP, courses like math, biology, and language are the foundation of children’s part of growing both in analytical thinking and emotional thinking. Moreover, the ability of children to count is because they learn math at school, their communication skill is level up because they learn a language subject at school, and they are aware of the natural environment because they learn it in biology. 

On the other hand, school should be the best place for students to learn everything, including learning hard or soft skills like cooking, dressmaking, and woodwork. This idea could be added in extracurricular activities. Looking at SKY High School in South Korea, this school even has 30 clubs for extracurricular activities. The teachers also believe that the students can be rich by having a lot of skills to help them get accepted in high-ranked universities. Turns out, 60% of students in SKY High School get accepted in top 3 universities in Korea and Global because of some competitions in soft skill and hard skill like cheerleading, computing, and boxing.

In conclusion, learning cannot be lacking in various subjects only. It is absolutely important to consider theoretical achievement in examinations, but it will be more beneficial if students can master both in academic and non-academic areas."
"Schools should focus on academic success and passing examinations. Skills such as cookery, dressmaking and woodwork should not be taught at school as it is better to learn these from family and friends. To that extent do you agree or disagree.","There are numerous opinions about school curriculums and learning activities. For some people, science and social subjects are essential for academic achievements and future research, while the opposite views that hard and vocational skills should be included in school subjects. In my personal opinion, the former stance should be mainly focused on junior and high schools, while the latter would be better to implement in daily essentials and higher education to improve beneficial activities.

It is an undeniable argument that children should gain wide and comprehensive knowledge from schools. To achieve that, the curriculum and learning activities should contain subjects about natural science and social to give the students a better understanding of life beyond their environment and to prepare them for future challenges. Subjects such as physics, biology, or geography are not human's natural knowledge but rather researched and studied by other people in the past and passed along to our generation. When these methods succeed, the students can determine what subjects should be focused on with advanced education.

Opposite to academic subjects, vocational subjects are our natural habits of survival skills that should be trained and learned from our colleagues and families. We have seen so many people practicing cooking activities, crafting, or building something. People who need to become experts and express their interest in hard skills should enter specialized schools of vocation, but every person should at least understand how to implement them in daily activities.

In conclusion, academic and examination purposes should be taught in schools, while technical skills should be gained from observing and training."
Children find it difficult to concentrate on or pay attention to their studies in school. What are the reasons? How can we solve this problem?,"Kids are nation builders, and how we are developing them is going to decide the future of the country . However, it is found that offsprings are being distracted and losing control over studies. Although this could be a result of electronic gadgets and social pressure, implementing mindfulness and cocentration in school curriculam makes things better.

To begin with, youngones are being introduced to digital devices such as, smartphones, tablets, and gaming consoles,  at early age. Consequently, these things are becoming an interegal part of their life, which provide them instant entertainmment and gratification. Spending plenty of time on electronic devices results in more distracted and less focused. Moreover, the social pressure is the second biggeset reasons of under performance of students as getting good grades has become social status nowadays. The offsprings are being pressured to cram the sllyabus instead of understand it practically, as a consequece of which, children find study less interesting. Therefore,  paying less attention to studies is becoming common among youngones.

To improve this condition, there should an implemention of mindfulness and concentration lessons in school curriculam, where students must taught how to improve focus and what to do when feel distracted? For instance, according to the report of Ontario Private School Limited, kids show more interest in learning after attending mindfulness classes as compared children, who did not go to classes. Therefore, youngones should be motivated to attend mental health periods for more concenteration.

To conclude, there is need to make chnages in both study sllyabus and daily routine of the youngones . Although teachnology is becoming more essential these days, it's impact on children's mental health can not be tolerated."
Children find it difficult to concentrate on or pay attention to their studies in school. What are the reasons? How can we solve this problem?,"Children's attitude toward learning has been a serious concern among many educationalists for a long period of time. It seems that there are many children who have  difficulty  focusing on their studies. In this essay, I will examine some primary reasons behind this trend and provide practical solutions to promote their academic performance.

One of the important reasons to reduce children 's attention to their studies comes from their growing dependence on technological gadgets in modern society. In other words, children tend to spend more time enjoying various activities on their own smartphones and computers today. They are easily distracted by a number of popups of the latest news and events from their friends, which makes it more difficult for them to concentrate on their studies as they cannot help but check them and respond. Such incessant communication online discourages many children from taking enough time to contemplate difficult problems they should learn. They tend to be less patient and anxious when they keep hearing the vibrations and sounds from their device.  Therefore, the prevalence of  electric tools has a negative effect on their ability to analyze in depth and think critically. 

In order to increase the level of concentration among young learners, it is significant for them to study in a quiet place. Such a suitable environment where children can be apart from the surrounding noise should be well prepared by parents and schools. Their smartphones and other personal electric tools should be handed to adults or should be turned off for their study time. This will encourage more young learners to focus on their academic performance without feeling anxious to check them. In fact, the prolonged period of their concentration allows them to achieve higher goals. It will also raise their motivation as they come to understand the importance of new knowledge in their life. 

In conclusion, the spreading use of digital gadgets among young adults makes it difficult to sustain their attention on their studies. Adults should take responsibility for the management of their screen time in order to raise their concentration on academic study."
Many customs and traditional ways of behavior are no longer relevant to modern life and not worth keeping. Do you agree or disagree?,"Few argue that the importance of customs and traditions should not be appropriate for behaving in modern life. Although I reject this viewpoint to some extent, I largely concur with the idea that the originality of customs and traditions should not be diminished because it is a part of cultural heritage, and this essay will justify my stance with examples.

Exploring my main stance, one pivotal point to consider is customs and traditions are created from rigid configurations, but it still alive and ready to adapt for innovation in the modern era. When nations pose threats from external culture, it leads to the process of assimilation where both conventional things and new things are mixed to create new traditions without changing the originality. For example, Japan, the most prestigious country, has a special attitude to always giving honor to the older one, even though the world has changed, the inhabitants believe that older people are part of their ancestors who worked as successors in the past. Customs and Traditions show the uniqueness of the nations is additional justification to support this side. If the country diminishes its local customs and traditions, then the originality of the country's behavior would be lost.

Shifting to the minor side, it is important to recognize that sometimes customs and traditions should not be the way of thinking about behavior because they have many drawbacks, such as praying to statues and sacrificing people for ceremonial events. Not only does it prevent the country from modern development But also it can be categorized as negative impact on society. 

In conclusion, despite the relevance of customs and traditions not truly working amid the change of behavior, my significant accordance is that both of them need to be preserved because each country has specific customs and traditions"
"In cities and towns all over the world the high volume of traffic is a problem.

What are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem?","It is undoubtedly the case that the urban areas are suffering from high volume traffic congestion. There are many arguments for  this problem and plenty of solutions to mitigate this issue. In this essay, I will discuss the criterion and also highlight some solutions that should be taken by the government authorities.

The very first step is to find out the argument behind a wide range of gridlock. In brief, there are several reasons for the rising traffic jams. Firstly, one of the major causes is overpopulation of the city areas. Most of the offices and factories are situated in urban areas which is why job opportunities are comparatively higher in the towns than in rural areas. For this instance, most of the village people migrate to the city space for the sake of getting a job. Secondly, cars are now more affordable for massive consumers. Most of the job holders are trying to reach the office by the car without any co-passenger except the driver , therefore, roads are blocked with cars in office hours and cause serious movement issues. Thirdly, the roads and lanes are not well constructed. The unorganized roads are a great reason for high-rise traffic.

To solve this critical problem the government should take some necessary steps. Some of the factories should be shifted to different rural areas therefore, many people will also shift to those areas for their job purposes. The tax rate on cars should be increased. If the tax rate is high then it will not be so easy to maintain the cost of a car and there will be fewer cars on the road. Eco-friendly vehicles like bicycles can be used for easy transportation instead of cars. Finally, the authorities should construct the road in a proper way and develop separate lanes for trucks and buses. 

To sum up, traffic jams can be caused by many reasons. If the government and general people work in a proper way to solve this problem then it is possible to get rid of this high volume of traffic."
"In cities and towns all over the world, the high volume of traffic is a problem. What are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem?","Around the world, the increasing volume of traffic at an alarming rate is a big concern. There are many causes due to which the traffic on roads is increasing every day while a number of actions can be taken with immediate effects to mitigate the huge traffic. This essay will present my views on both sides.

To begin with, the main cause of huge traffic is overpopulation in the major cities and towns. In addition to that, the lack of better road infrastructures, lenient rules and regulations to monitor the traffic and less use of public transport has led to increasing in traffic ,especially during peak hours. For instance, Bangalore, a city in India is not only known as the IT hub of India but also known for the busiest traffic among the popular cities across the globe. The situation has become bad to worse in the span of a few years. Furthermore, the number of private vehicles on roads has doubled over the period of five years causing air pollution which is impacting an individual physically and mentally.

On the other hand, Government should immediately take necessary actions to reduce traffic. Widening the roads, creating separate lanes for two- wheelers and four-wheelers, better facilities and affordable public transport could be the best options for any cities or towns facing huge traffic problems. Metro facilities and world-class buses should be introduced on roads for the public. Government should implement strict laws such as mandatory use of public transport once a week by an individual to curb the traffic problems to some extent.

To conclude, Government should take immediate action to reduce the traffic problems in cities otherwise, it will increase issues such as air pollution, damage to roads and the productivity of an individual day by day."
"In some cites and towns all over the world ,the high volume of traffic is a problem.what are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem?","There is no denying the fact that the high volume of traffic is considered a problem in some cities and towns all over the world. The traffic congestion problem is the trending problem nowadays, therefore, this essay will demonstrate the causes and the solution to this problem. 

There are many factors that unfortunately increase the high volume of traffic. Recently, the industry of cars has been significantly improving and it has motivated people to buy cars more. For instance, electric cars have been popularly introduced to us which led to having more cars running on our streets. Equally important is the percentage of rider capacity, it is the percentage of how many persons are in one vehicle for each trip, and it is approximately 1.1 riders per vehicle. This percentage is a result of people wanting their privacy during their trips, and fewer people using public transportation. 

Traffic congestion can luckily be improved. many studies have proven that with control measures and sharing awareness, traffic congestion can be improved. As revealed, making public transportation more comfortable and fixed headways can be one of the most effective ways to ensure that people are using the bus more. In addition, Carpooling concept can be shared through the people, where people can ride along with each other if they were going on the same route. Moreover, a solution to this problem can be constructing a new road for bicycles to motivate people that they can go to work using their bikes. 

On the whole, the traffic congestion problem is man-made, hence, it can be solved easily by taking some measures and having the willingness to accept new ways and methods. In the meantime, more studies should be conducted to analyze the operational performance of roads."
"In cities and towns all over the world, the high volume of traffic is a problem. What are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem?","A means of transportation is an extremely creative invention in the modern world. Since the industrial revolution, there have been a lot of vehicles which were invented around the world. These vehicles include cars, trains, speed railways and motorcycles. Clearly, it is significant for humans to utilize such convenient vehicles to arrive at other places though the drawback is they may affect traffic and environmental problems.

It is useful to take vehicles to reach everywhere although it will cause traffic jams and gas exhaust. That is, the more frequently people use vehicles, the more traffic and environmental issues will arise. These vehicles will produce a great deal of detrimental exhaust to the environment because there are plenty of people in urban cities who drive their cars and motorcycles to commute. Additionally, there will usually be traffic jams after work and school so that many cars and motorcycles are pretty crowded and pedestrians have trouble walking.

In order to solve traffic jams and harmful exhaust, governments should establish legislation to regulate the proper amount of exhaust emission. Governments also need to build traffic lights to control car flows so as to protect pedestrians from being hit. Moreover, pedestrians have to take traffic lessons to know the knowledge of traffic rules. In that way, there will be less car accidents occurring and problems of traffic jams will be relieved.

Overall, a means of transportation is actually beneficial for humans to arrive everywhere. Nevertheless, it will cause traffic jams in cities and impact detrimental exhaust to the environment. If governments set up a law to control exhaust emission and pedestrians know how crucial traffic rules are, traffic problems will be resolved and people will become more safe."
"Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people, while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate.



Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","A heated argument regarding main topic arises because while some insist that the purpose of museums is entertainment where anyone can enjoy, others assert that museums should be educational places for people to study. Although the latter has advantages, I still believe that the former has far exceeding positive impacts for everyone.

There is no doubt that some individuals are steadfast to believe that museums are traditionally studying place. Firstly, there are garden-variety cultural products, and nation’s treasures that are value of historical heritages. To give an example, most of school trips go to museum to see these precious educational research to study history. It is a good opportunity for them to see heritages in person that are written in textbooks. Furthermore, lots of explanations of the cultural products are written in different languages that foreigners understand why this product was made and what was the purpose of, hence they can also learn educational knowledge.

In contrast, I am of the opinion that visiting museums for entertainment purpose has utmost impression owing to the fact that tons of museums’ concepts are changing in nowadays. It is true that every people can enjoy museums even for whom can not read letters or do not have any historical knowledge. In recent years museums are not only consisted of studying place with preserve historical things but also there are various places such as café, restaurant, entertainment place, and so on. Needless to say, there are virtual spaces that can experience 4D sites or photo zones that will improve people’s logical and critical thinking. To further illustrate this point, one research from the US University said that most of family groups are likely to visit museums for entertainment purpose.

In conclusion, the bottom line is that while using museums for education studies has good effects, as far as I am concerned, the purpose of enjoying museums in various ways has a superior indispensable influence for the parties involved."
Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"It is a common belief that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people. While others think that the purpose of museums is to educate. In this essay, I will elaborate on both sides and then state my position.

On the first hand, the reason people state that museums are entertaining places is that many recreation activities inside the museums will attract more visitors to come and learn about the local history. This means many Competition with many alluring prizes will encourage people and bring them to learn. Beside that, some documentary movies about historical events are not only entertaining it also help people easy to get access to knowledge with passive learning. Had it not been for many events to bring more participants to the museums and that support the government widen the gallery scale.

On the second hand, others hold the view that a historical gallery is a place where visitors explore the history of the nation. In addition, it is very possible for those who  really care and want to learn deeply in an academic way. In particular, it also depends on the reverence of what they exhibit. A good example of it is the Museumisit which is the Museum of Vietnamese History. Inside History of it has an exhibit of a mummy exhibit a mummy of a woman and that is the reason why the museums do not allow the use of cameras and keep silent during the visiting process. As a consequence, because of the reverence of traditions inside the hall, hall that they do not accept many recreational activities.

To conclude, many people think opinions that historical galleries should be enjoyable places for a place to people, while others support the view the purpose of museums is told to educate. In my opinion, an opinion that it has many great places for entertaining, not entertaining not necessarily museums necessarily is museums and I agree that the exhibit that exhibit is a purpose for educating."
Many students find it harder to study when they are at university or college than when they were at school. Why is this? What can be done to solve the problem?,"It is true that many students tend to meet several challenges due to the differences between studying at school and at college or university. To explain this tendency, I think that the reasons behind this phenomenon are the distinction of subjects and how to learn in these educational environments. My essay also mentions potential solutions relating to the convenience of technologies to solve this.

To begin with, there are many factors contributing to the increased difficulty that students experience in higher education, compared to their time in school. Firstly, the main reason relates to the subjects they have to learn. If there is a plethora of fundamental knowledge that school’s syllabus teaches students can be seen in a variety of aspects such as math, geography or science, it is different for students to level up to university or college. Many classes in the tertiary levels tend to focus on one aspect depending on the majors students follow. To be more understandable, a university student’s specialization is economics and finance, for example, find more difficulties in their academic credits such as microeconomics, even though it is a high-level version of math which she or he had learnt since high school Moreover, acquiring knowledge in university or college is considered as tougher, because of the root of the distinctive learning methods. In Vietnam, for instance, teachers usually prepare diments for each lesson and it is compulsory for students to learn these by heart leading to the insurance of passing the tests. However, the opposite was true in university, professors often teach basic sections in class, thus it is obligatory for students to do more research by compiling materials and preparing lesson plans for their own to fully understand.

There are many solutions that could be implemented to address these challenges. In the contemporary era, it is reckoned that the significant development of technological devices could improve students’ path of intelligence. Firstly, having too many paper materials leads to  difficulty in finding out what students need for each subject. People could take photos of these and upload them to a computer which could rearrange them into separate folders named to each class. As a result, students could open tons of documents with a click without messing around. Secondly, there are websites that enhance doing tasks. For example, Chat GBT, an AI chatbot would be a magic tool giving a variety of ideas whether university students are in a situation of running out of ideas for assignments or even answering tricky math questions.

In conclusion, the transition from school to university or college should pose many pressures due to the difficulty of academic subjects and imparting knowledge. However,  applying several digital technologies would strengthen learning well."
"In some countries, there has been an increase in the number of parents who educate their children themselves at home instead of sending them to school. Do you think the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?","Education is the foundation upon which one build their future. In this 21st century, home-education is being preferred by numerous parents rather than the primitive way of learning within school premises. In my opinion, there are some benefits; however, these pale in comparison with the potential drawbacks. Various reasons behind this notion are explained explicitly in the following paragraphs.

To commence with, one of the major demerits of not visiting the school is, children will not receive legitimate degree certificates. In this contemporary era, education qualification along with valid proof of one’s capability is the most crucial thing to achieve. If a child does not have formal education, they will not be able to sit for any competitive examinations and job interviews, which require proficiency. Without authorized and verified documents not only getting the job is difficult but also salary will reduce drastically. To illustrate, a survey conducted by the University of California reveals that a carpenter’s wage per hour is 35 dollars on  average, who have completed a diploma. Whereas, who learned from experience and practice at home, earns 25 dollars  each hour. In fact, if home-educated children decide to enrol themselves for any degree course in the near future, they are less likely to get a chance for admission.

In addition, school-going young people learn how to make friends and appropriate way of behaving with various persons present inside the campus. Moreover, adjustment quality in the tenacious situations has been developed by them. By working and playing with friends they learn leadership, teamwork, moral values, the significance of collaborative and collective work. All these skills assist them to enhance their level of competency and capacity as well as improvement of their cognitive development. Research published by the study committee of India displays that offspring taught by teachers are highly sociable and skilled as compare to others, who are grown up in the homely environment, for instance. Besides, a young mind will be deprived of having all the fun activities and above-mentioned qualities, which everyone should have, to lead a successful life.

To recapitulate, I am a firm believer in the fact that this ongoing escalating trend has severe detrimental impacts on an individual’s life. The importance of educational institutions is indispensable and everybody should taste that life in order to obtain the goal of developing healthier pursuits."
"In some countries, there has been an increase in the number of parents who educate their children themselves at home instead of sending them to school. Do you think the advantage of this outweigh the disadvantages?","In contemporary era an academic qualification is most crucial aspect of individual life. In a few regions, there has been a soaring  a plethora of families is teaching their offspring on their own rather than taking them to school. According to my notion, there are several detrimental effects of to teaching  an infant at home.

To begin with, nowadays parents are more concern about their toddler career. Hence, they teach them at their own instead of sending them a seminary. Although, the institute is providing each and every facility that a student required. As a consequence, the pupil is unaware of the environment of the school. Which lead to rid of their ability to socialize with other's. For instance, Those infants prepare at home having a less social skill and facing a difficulty while talking with others.

On the other hand, there are several merits of this trend such as, those offspring are who learn academic aspects through the parents get better attention from them. Despite this, instead of studying where a huge number of students learn, it is even more beneficial to study at a house. For example, If the mother is teaching their children, she will give her best and focusing more on week part of their which is not possible with faculty. 

To conclude, after musing both sides I believe that minor must be sent to academy instead educating them at home. As there are a plethora of disadvantages of teaching them home.As they can learn effective social skill and get attach with institutionalised atmosphere."
"In some countries, there has been an increase in the number of parents who educate their children themselves at home instead of sending them to school. Do you think the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?","There are more and more parents who would like to teach their children at home rather than letting them learn at schools in some states. I think these parents' views are unreasonable and its disadvantages outweigh the advantages, because firstly, schools have more professional learning resources than home and secondly, pupils obtain the unique group experiences at the schools. 

The education departments and agencies control the largest amount of education resources than single family. Kindergartens, schools and collages own a lot of teaching materials, instructing aids, professional teachers and considerate libraries for students. Meanwhile, the governments invest a large amount of money to each school in order to continue improving teaching and learning efficiency of them. Kids will be difficult to access these benefits if parents do not send them to school. For example, in Shanghai, each primary school is funded by the local authority nearly one million pounds to develop their teachers' group and teaching devices, which is impossible to be achieved in any pupil's home. 

In addition, students can acquire the experiences of collective lives. Some people might argue that teaching children at home which is the one-to-one model. This will be more effective for learners to get a better grade in the exams. However, examination is not the only goal of the education. Understanding how to cooperate with others and communication skills in the same age groups are also essential for each child. For instance, except for lessons, there are many activities and workshops organised in schools. Pupils could understand a lot of rules to cooperate with others and the communication strategies to make others feeling comfortable. These experiences can only be acquired at schools. 

In conclusion, I believe its disadvantages overweigh the benefits that teaching children at home rather than sending them to school, because children cannot access many professional instructing resources and get collective experiences."
It is important for all towns and cities to have large public spaces such as squares and parks. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Spacious public spaces such as parks and squares are required for all towns and cities to have. I stand with this perspective and from this essay i will explain the reason with supporting opinion.

Squares and parks are necessary to have in every cities and sould in a big size. This place could give several benefits for nature and society. Most of the cities are full of concentrate building, therefore parks or squares is important space for trees or small forest in the middle of the city. The existence of forest is to absorb carbon dioxide that produced by human activity. For instance, smoke from burnt fossil fuel cars can be captured by the trees. Thus the trees could process the photosyntesis to make an oxygen and give a fresh air. 

Regarding the benefit for the society, parks and squares could provide spaces for entertaiment or to relax. Living in a city sometimes can be bored and leads to stress, because of the traffic congestion or pressure from work. Hence, parks or squares are needed for citizen to enjoy their time and breath some fresh air. Many activities can be done here, such as yoga, picnic, jogging, or just strolling around to enjoy weekend. As a result, this places could help people to achieve their work-life-balance without should going a long ride to coutryside. To illustrate, many activities are held in parks on the weekend such as aerobic or zumba to encourage healty lifestyle and better health.

In conclusion, a large park or square brings several benefits to both nature and society. Therefore, I remain convinced that this idea should be maintained."
It is important for all towns and cities to have large outdoor public spaces such as squared and parks. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"It is argued that there should be more open squared spaces and colossal parks in all cities and towns. I do completely agree with the given statement and would give supportive points in this essay. 

Firstly, places like parks and gardens with beautiful flowering plants and trees provide an identity to a city or town and undoubtedly provide considerable benefits to the surrounding community.  Furthermore, these are beneficial for personal health as well. 

For instance, children can have outdoor sports, and adults after their busy tiring work life can have a relaxed time as well as can do routine walking in a healthy space. 

Such spaces allow citizens to appreciate nature's arts and to have knowledge and connections with its vast beauty among city skyscrapers, industries and other townhouses. One can easily understand and appreciate this while sitting in the Royal Botanical Garden in Melbourne City or Hyde Park in  London. These cities are recognized by these gardens and attract even tourists.

Another very significant point is about their role in cleaning pollution. As we know, these days air pollution is a major issue due to traffic and factories and it is considerably affecting people's health. Therefore, it is essentially a requirement these days to have spaces on every corner with implanted trees and plants in the form of squared spaces and central bigger parks. Trees and surrounding greeneries clean atmospheric pollution by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. 

This thus keeps people away from many air-borne diseases and stress and they can work more efficiently with a healthy body and mind. 

In conclusion, it is a fundamental need nowadays to build parks in the cities and towns for the benefit of its people and  our earth and I completely agree with the given statement."
It is important for all towns and cities to have large public outdoor places like squares and parks. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, many developmentsoccurs in all over the world so many cities and towns have all facilities such as parks , gardens and many more and it places more beneficial for individuals also so than I completely agree with this develpoments.

Many small cities and towns did not have muchmodern technology and equipment so they all migrated from to another big city or town therefore if stats have parks and gardens so people go for some refreshment also .Moreover , it will be beneficial to children's growth becuase in this days many parents lived in cities or towns which have many fascinate places for visiting and rejuinaite. For example , my city have so many gardens and rivers do public often go there for time spending after exam and job .

In addition , it is quite necessary for all age groups people becuase in the morning they go to some park for exercising and older people often go to parks or gardens becuase they have lot of time and they spent with their dear once . Similarly. if cities have so many gardens so they also have trees and plants so that air pollution can be decreased . Apart from this many parents like to go for walk with their children after job or meal so they can also spend more time with family members and friends. Furthermore , many doctors also said that having parks and gardens near by your home is very important for good health and air.

In conclusion, many outdoor places like this having number of benefits for humans development not only for physical grwoth but also mental stuff. So that all cities and town will  build gardens and outdoor parks more in future."
It is a good idea to have large public spaces in towns and cities such as parks and squares. Do you agree or disagree? Why?,"With the increasing population around the world, the urban areas of most major cities and capitals like Bangkok are going to get larger over time. The government ,therefore, needs to plan carefully about where and how to expand in the most efficient way and support  future development as well. However, one thing that most governments prefer to place with living buildings is the public zone like parks or squares. In my opinion, there are several advantages with those public zones placed within the urban areas due to three main reason

s.

The first reason is that the public space can be a good model to teach their citizens about  environmental or social responsibilities. Many public spots are welcome by everyone, so it is people’s responsibility to learn how to act and care for others as everyone is the owner of these areas. Moreover, most public spaces, especially parks, give out a good resemblance to living with nature. This does not just give beauty to their cities, but also makes people love nature, and consider  protecting and solving the environmental issues occurring from human activities like the greenhouse effect, or the PM 2.5 issue.

Another reason is that people can use public grounds to reduce their stress. Due to rapid technological changes, people are becoming more comfortable inside their homes and becoming more introverted personalities. Nonetheless, spending days inside their home independently will stress out many of them because humans are social species by nature. This makes the public location become an ideal place for everyone to face a refreshing atmosphere where there are many physical activities like running or yoga  and surrounded by beautiful trees and flowers. 

Lastly, public spaces can create income for the cities. Due to the advancement of engineering technology, the design of buildings and areas in public locations have become tourist attractions in many major metropolises. The more declarations and unique designs will be the destinations for both locals and tourists to take photos, and spend money and time there. This will significantly increase the income of the overall metropolis especially the areas nearby attractions.  

In conclusion, the public ground can teach society in terms of environmental and social responsibilities, and help reduce people's stress from spending days inside their homes. Consequently, I agree that public field should be placed along with every large city."
It is important for all towns and cities to have large public outdoor places like squares and parks. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Establishing a large public place outdoors such as parks and town squares seems only reasonable for those wealthier municipalities able to upgrade their image, but such a proposal in my opinion might not be applicable to other cities and towns. This essay will present some reasons to support my argument. 

One of the main ideas that some towns believe building such grand public spaces is for the pursuit of tourism. The city planners, often at the behest of developers and greedy construction interests will attempt to invest in these improvement schemes in the hopes of luring visitors and potential new residents. This often seems to be a shortsighted choice for imaginary economics with no guarantee that out of town visitors will in fact come and see the finish project. Granted, there may also be some minor benefits for local residents such as being able to practice in an expansive area and being able to socialize in a varied context in terms of new acquaintances in an open environment. Truthfully, most of these places are often abandoned and neglected. 

Next not all towns and cities are capable of transforming their public areas into such massive single use developments. To be more specific, the cost of establishing a gigantic public space is high. While local governments should consider the potential revenue from tourism, ultimately they need to focus on staying within their budgets for any public project. If the investment is far more than what could be afforded, then creating a huge garden or public square of some kind would only end up as an unfinished project. This came at the cost of rooting up many of the older residents at a higher payout from the taxpayers and left many of the plans on the drawing board as the majority of these construction plots simply ran out of city financing to be completed. 

In conclusion, I would continue to argue that this desire to improve a town or city by building a large public square or park may in fact be much more costly than expected compared to the little return in potential tourist revenue simply because the tourism market has shifted and these old ways of attracting people to a city are no longer valid."
Some universities offer online courses as an alternative to classes delivered on campus. Do you think this is a positive or negative development?,"Owing to the advancement of technology, more and more educational institutuions are offering online courses. As a result, students are given additional freedom in different aspects. In this essay, I will elaborate on why I believe that this is a positive development and outline main benefits.

To begin with, the opportunity to attend lectures on the internet platforms istead of inperosn, contributes to a solution of the main struggle of nearly every student, financial strain. Namely, having classes on campus is followed by few costs which can be easily avoided by simply staying at home, including all transportation fees and expenses of eating out for instance. This may seem insignificant, but when compounded, it usually cause headaches to both, pupils and families. Hence, without a need to visit a university, student might save a considerable sum of money on a yearly basis. 

Moreover, attending educational institution is frequently highly time consuming, especially for the learners who live further away. Not only the transportation can take you a lot of time but it leaves you  nearly none freedom for the time management. In other words, opportunity to organise your day to a little detail, including meal breaks, lecture time or leisure activities, leads to higher productivity and consequently more free time. Therefore, the less strict the time-table is, the more enjoyable the individual will find studying.

In conlusion,  I am of the opinion that off campus education is strongly advantageous and thus the positive development. Hopefully, more universities will offer such programmes in the near future."
Some universities offer online courses as an alternative to classes delivered on campus. Do you think this is a positive or negative development?,"Every civilian should be Mahatma Gandhi to his society. There is no doubt that online education has become a new learning trend. However, while I agree that they also have negative aspects, still I believe that this advanced technology is mainly beneficial to  individuals. In this essay, I will  support my view with examples.

 During the coronavirus pandemic, offline schooling became more challenging. The universities had to start web-based classes, in order to stop coronavirus from affecting the younger generation's health. In initial studies, it was declared that this virus is more dangerous to the youth. In such a situation, it was difficult to continue the academic system without wasting kids studies and maintaining their health. At that time, virtual tuitions were only the possible option that can save school learner's years and well-being simultaneously. due to this solution, the youngsters can connect with their teachers and faculty. They can learn new concepts and clear their doubts. Moreover, they can even conduct digital examinations.

Another major advantage of attending  such courses is that it saves time. Nowadays, time plays a crucial role in our life. If a working person wants to pursue a specific program then it may become difficult for him to make a balance between his job and exams, as he also needs to travel to his university to attend the classes. As a consequence, it becomes hard to concentrate on both the tasks and he may lose his focus and leads to mental pressure. While applying for such alternatives, it can save his travelling time and he can also utilize his travelling  time in learning. In recent years, there are many applications are available in the market and with their ,help you can select your stream. One such example is the Upgrade application. 

In conclusion, despite there are few reasons why we should value offline education, I'm inclined to consider that the pros of online education outnumber the cons."
It is more important to spend public money promoting a healthy lifestyle in order to prevent illness than to spend it on the treatment of people who are already ill. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is often said that in order to fight diseases, the government should invest more money in encouraging a healthy lifestyle in lieu of spending money on the treatment of people who are already suffering from illness. In my view, I partially advocate the idea. And through this essay, I aim to analyse my standpoints in order to reach a relevant conclusion.

On the one hand, I agree that a large proportion of the state budget should be allocated to activities or campaigns that promote a healthy lifestyle. This is because a lot of diseases nowadays are actually the direct result of people's unhealthy habits. For example, children who eat fast food on a daily basis commonly can suffer from a range of health issues, namely weight problems and obesity. These diseases can be prevented if people are made more aware of the severe consequences of an unhealthy diet and the benefits of sustaining a good health. In addition, there are a number of incurable diseases, such as HIV, AIDS and many forms of cancer. Of course, there are drugs and treatments that can prolong the life of patients suffering from such diseases, but the better solution in this case is obviously trying to prevent these diseases from occurring, instead of trying to cure them, which can often place a heavy burden on patients' families, and on society as a whole.

On the other hand, the treatment for people who are already ill should also receive adequate funding, due to the fact that some diseases simply cannot be prevented. People living in many tropical or coastal regions, for example, are highly vulnerable to waterborne diseases after a natural disaster such as a tsunami or heavy flooding. Besides, there are also some illnesses and disorders that are inherited. For instance, if a person suffers from asthma, it is highly likely that his children will also contract respiratory diseases, regardless of their diet or lifestyle. These mentioned cases would be almost impossible for people or the government to prevent; therefore, money needs to be spent on the treatment of patients.

All things considered, both promoting a healthy lifestyle and spending money on the treatment of people who are already ill are equally important in the fight against diseases, and each country should develop flexible plans to adapt to different situations."
It is more important to spend public money promoting a healthy lifestyle in order to prevent illness than to spend it on the treatment of people who are already ill. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"A healty lifestly can bring us a joyful life, which a healthy person can live better than a weathly person.  Today we need to disscuss this topic of where we should spend the money, on a adverstiment of how to improve our healthy life, or to use for health equiments for the people who are already sick. I believe an adverstiment will make people aware of the sick, as if we could see some useful ads on tv everyday. 

In today society, most of the people busier on work, which they don't have time to prepare dinner, their will prefer to order a fast food or buy some per-make food. As we know all of these food are unhealthy, if you eat once in a blue moon that is fine, but over intake will make people gain weight or have hight cholesterol. Therefore, I think it is good idea to spend some money on the newspaper or television to let people know how to prevent the unhealthy lifestyle. Moreover, the community money can also use to workout equiments in public park, which this could help too. 

On the other hand, hospital it needs to have more equiment for the patiens, as it today society, cancer is the most serious ill, also we have covid-19 virus, which it spreading very quick and we have no way to control at the moment. So that hospital or clinic needs to have more funds for the treatment or test kit. 

In conclusion, I agree public funds should be using on media to let people understand, if you want to live longer, must have a healthy body."
It is more important to spend public money on promoting a healthy lifestyle in order to prevent illness than to spend it on treatment of people who are already ill. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"A controversial issue in todays world relates to promoting the health of citizens. Some argue that we must prevent illnesses by investing in people's health while others argue that we can treat them. In my opinion, preventing is by far a better option than curing. 

The government should spend money on providing easy and affordable gyms. A place in every company or appartment where individuals are forced or pushed into doing an exercise. Having physical activity can help people with many pains or diseases. Additionally, if eveyone schedules a well-maintained work out program for themselves or with the help of trainers it will help with not having to struggle with many illnesses specially in a young age. 

Furthermore, the government should take away the tax on healthy foods and increase the tax on unhealthy foods. Currently, unhealthy foods which will cause many illnesses such as diabites and cancer are much cheaper than healthy foods like greens and grains. Moreover, the public money should also be spent on advertisments, free classess and application that will help families to gain knowledge on how to live a better and healthier lifestyle along with at home group excercises and meal plans that every one can enjoy. 

As a conclusion, while illnesses and diseases will always be inevitable helping ourselves to maintain a healthier life is always a better opition than having to cure. I completely agree with the argument that governemnt fundings should be used to prevent illness and promote the overall public health."
"In many countries, people decide to have children at a later age than in the past. Why? Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","These days, many couples opt for delayed childbirth. This trend can be attributed to career priorities. From my point of view, I consider that it has more drawbacks, especially the health of their offspring.

On the one hand, postponing parenthood can bring about significant advantages. Firstly, parents have financial stability after concentrating completely on their career. Therefore, children may receive a better education quality in a precious school. In addition, when pregnant at a later age, couples are more mature in emotional aspect, so their spouse relationship can become more stable. Furthermore, they would be ready to take care of their children. For instance, children who were born in families by elderly parents tend to be paid more attention than others since their parents have more family time.

On the other hand, embarking on parenthood at a later age can have unexpected disadvantages. First of all, that can increase the generation gap between parents and their offspring, leading to familial conflicts. In terms of the long run side, parents may not be around for as long as their children need them. Moreover, babies in such families are susceptible to mental diseases due to gene fault. As a case in point, according to health-related studies, infants who were born by mothers over 35 years old are prone to Down syndrome.

To sum up, opting for pregnancy at a later age can be because of heightened monetary burdens. That brings certain pros and cons about health and family aspects. From my perspective, the disadvantages should be given more concern than advantages."
"People nowadays tend to have children at older ages.

Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?","Having children at a younger age has always been supported by society. But over the last decades people started to rethink parenting, and the age of having the first baby has increased. This essay will discuss both advantages and disadvantages of this issue.

First, postponing the birth of the first child more likely will lead to having fewer children in general, and this fact has a direct influence on the age pyramid of society. It means these generations will suffer from the tax burden, as they will need to take care of previous generations where 4-6 children in the family were normal. Governments will have to cut funding of public sectors, which consequently will decrease the life quality of some groups. For example, possible decisions could be increasing the retirement age or reduction in the amount of social benefits.

Although there is a high risk of difficulties with taxes in the future, I believe that having beloved and well-educated children will bring much more benefits to humanity. People at older ages tend to perceive parenthood as a responsible and important deal, so there are more chances that they will do their best while raising an infant. Well-educated and confident individuals are considered to generate more wealth and have less deviant conduct. According to the American Correctional Association, three-quarters of serial killers were grown in dysfunctional families and were unwanted children. 

In conclusion, despite some demerits, having a baby at older age is more advantageous as parents can provide a better life and upbringing. Therefore, this trend should be welcomed and encouraged."
Some people believe that a great difference in age between people and children is more beneficial. Do you think the advantages of a greater difference in age between them outweigh the disadvantages?,"Well i would like to show some glimpse of my practical exposure

In the first year in the second ,semester I-_  learned how to procure milk for the plant

at that time we have visited various dairy farm and collection center

it was the time we learn about handling of raw milk.

At second year we have visited chhattisgarh state largest plant which was Vachan milk processing plant.it was situated some around 40 km far from our college campus."
"most people decided to have children in their later age than in the past. why? do the advantages of this outweigh its disadvantages? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples,e.g from your knowledge or experience","In today's society, we are  seeing more conception than ever before. Obviously, it has its own merits and challenges and I strongly believe that the arguments in favour are stronger than against this trend. In this essay, I shall discuss both the pros and cons and substantiate the reasons behind the decisions with relevant examples.

First and foremost, the main reason behind late pregnancy is delayed economic stability owing to competition in employment. Presently, the job market is uncertain , and people take longer , to find fiscal stability, which in turn influences their decision to have kids. Moreover, the present system of both parents working has also aggravated this situation as most families are nuclear families while  the decision to raise offspring at the peak of their career is a difficult decision which most often gets  delayed. Studies have further revealed that the average maternity age in Japan and USA has risen owing to the present lifestyle.

The advantage can be found in the fact, that having a late offspring with better financial resources, helps in the proper upbringing and subsequent education  of young ones. An example can be found in Norway, where families conceiving late are more financially stable than early boomers. Another merit lies in the enhanced maturity of the parents in taking critical decisions for their children. For instance, studies reveal that younger parents tend to be more emotional, in decision-making  than their older counterparts, who are more rational .

The contrary argument is on medical grounds ,whereas late pregnancy leads to some complications and consequentially, enhanced medical costs which are best avoidable in the case of early childbirth. Medical journals reveal mothers above forty are more prone to c-section delivery than younger mothers.

Thus, we can conclusively declare, having studied both sides,s that it is more advantageous to conceive at a later stage in life than earlier, in spite of its medical challenges , since it is more rational economically and in terms of maturity."
More people decided to have children in their later age than in the past. Why? Do advantages outweigh the disadvantages.,"For years having a child had been viewed as the main purpose of marriage that needed to be achieved at last by the time the third wedding anniversary of a couple arrived but recently young population is taking a fresh look at it and prefer to delay it to their late thirties. A great number of rationales are being suggested for this phenomenon. Although delaying being parents has its own two sides, I believe its advantages do not clash with its disadvantages. Three reasons behind this subject are being discussed in this essay which is proceeding by the rationale for my belief.

To begin, waiting longer for being a parent might be preferable to having a child at an early age due to the revolution that was happened in the attitude of couples toward the consequences of giving birth. First of all, newlyweds are not looking at their children as an investment. On the contrary, people have been trying to look at this responsibility as a sensitive career that is essential for developing  society and it needs time to be learned.  In addition, the impact of the world industry downfall on this change is out of the question. For example, the inflation that has been growing over a few years ago deter couples from thinking of increasing their family members. In the end, selfishness might be another reason behind it. The abundant content with the subject of having fun is being distributed on  social media. Consequently, young couples are being enticed to pursue these activities rather than accepting the responsibility for taking care of an offspring.

On one hand, the experiences that we earn during enjoying our lives regardless of worrying for a child besides the chances that we might encounter to achieve more accomplishments before being  parents have been argued in the favour of postponing reproduction. On the other hand; as said above, we have a responsibility toward our society as a mother or father . As the age gap between us and our offspring becomes wider, the misunderstanding will be wider which can threaten the health of families. Moreover, this issue not only can affect  psychosocial health  but also can deduce biological diseases. For instance, it was proved that the prevalence of Down syndrome is greater in the babies of older mothers. Hence the drawbacks of this perspective are more significant than its incentives.

To sum up, delayed reproduction as a new preference of twenties century adults is rooted in their perspective toward parentship and enjoying life, also the industrial predicaments are playing a role. I believe it is noteworthy to bear in mind that the negative consequences of this preference are more cardinal than its positive effects."
"some people believe that a greater difference in age between parents and children is more beneficial than less of a difference. 
Do you think the advantages of a greater age difference outweigh the disadvantages?","Over the last two or three decades, late marriage has been raising tremendously than ever before; as a result, parents and children have a huge ade difference. However, some think that a huge age difference between parents and kids is more adavandages rather than a minimum age difference. I think this trend has more drawbacks than benefits, this essay discusses it briefly for the following reasons. 

To begin wiht, a huge age difference between fathers and mothers and kids have more disadvantages. Firstly, this can lead to being a generation gap between them; thus, mutual understanding might be missed betwen them. Secondly, these kind of parents will be old when theirs' children will be enter in teenage; thus, sometimes they cannot live more years with theirs' infants due to elder diseases. In addition, after one certain age, children look after theirs' parents when infants be in teenage, and therefore, infants cannot be delighted to theirs' life. For example, in the western nations people marry after fourty. Thus, many children live with single parent mother or father due to elder age diseases affect theirs' parents. Therefore, this trend gives more disadvantages. 

On the other hand, a huge age difference has some benefits for both fathers and infants. First, parents have more assets because they save more money for theirs' future after got married; thus, financial burdens do not disturb theirs' life. Second, parents and children have a mutual relationship maintain because parents have more maturity, and therefore, they can effortlessely understand about theirs' little buds needs and wants. For instance, in Indian also have a huge age difference between theirs' little ones, but they can live a happy life rather than a minimum age difference families. Hence, this situation has some benefits. 

To conclude, a great age gap between parents and toddlers can lead to getting misunderstanding and children cannot live happy in their teenage; they have more financial assests and maintain good reltionship between them. Therefore, I think this process has more disadvantages than advantages."
People nowadays tend to have children at older ages. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?,"In various countries around the world, more individuals prefer to become parents at elder age periods. While this can certainly offer an advantage, I believe that the drawbacks are of greater significance.

The benefit of having juveniles at old age is to give fathers the chance to become financially prepared for this challenge. It is mainly because raising a family and taking care of it require being settled with proper housing and fair salaries. This may take years after graduation to be accomplished. For example, in the country I was born, couples married after their forties due to the poor economical conditions of the citizens. Therefore, it could be an advantage not to have offspring without being ready for such responsibility. 

Conversely, there are many disadvantages that can result from raising youngsters at older ages. Firstly, the parent will be old when their minors are growing. Hence, an age barrier could prevent having a healthy relationship between guardians and their offspring. To give a clear example to this, a sixty years old father can hardly understand the mind of thirteen years teenager. In addition, fathers might be at critical ages and it is not convenient for them to take care of newborns. Whereas, younger fathers and mothers can easily stay awake all night or act more actively with their kids. Consequently, it is not preferred to have kids after the forties.

Another drawback is the fetal risk of giving birth to women after a certain life. Their bodies can be weaker and they might suffer many health issues during pregnancy. Therefore, it is extremely advisable for females to deliver before their thirties. 

To conclude, having children after certain ages might result in more stability. However, the cons of it are worth more considering because it can lead to fetal risks, besides, unmutual understanding between elder parents and their children."
"People nowadays tend to have children at older ages.

Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?","The past fifty years have seen a dramatic increase in the percentage of families who prefer to delay having  children. I argue this trend and it’s long term ramifications are negative in nature .This will be proven in the following lines.

Looking first at it’s positive impact, some people believe that spend a long time without children will enhance the relationship between the couples.They think thatevery one can realize and adjust himself with the other person and this will help them to prepare a positive family atmosphere to bring up the children.

Turning to the positive sides , children play a crucial role of the family stabilization. Each couples has their own conflicts and the relationship can break down at any time if they don not have children.The memories of the  family gathering and the future of those children make the parents thinking many times before taking the decision of divorec.Thus, the long term results of having children at older age can be seen as helpless.

Further and more importantly, It appears that bringing up children need a high physical efforts . children like to run, swim and play with their parents .If you have children when you are elderly, you will not be able to play with them.For instance one of my best friend always say to me that his father brought him when he was 60 years so,their relationship is weak. 

Bottomline,All this considered ,ther are both positive an negatives .I once a gain reaffirm my position the negative aspects excees the positive one ."
"More people decided to have children in their later age than in the past. Why?

Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Many couples are likely to have babies later than  normal ages, which is a social norm in many countries. Although this issue may cause some drawbacks, I personally think it is more beneficial for husbands and wives to become parents when they are more mature and get ready.

On the one hand, it is evident that having children early could reduce some worries about the low rate of prenancy and the health of mothers and babies when women get older. Numerous scientists have proven that the older we become, the more difficult we have babies, especially females over thirty years old. Moreover, there is a high percentage of infants born with disabled diseases after delivery if mothers are over thirty-five years old. Therefore, many people advocate that the ideal range of ages to be pregnant is between twenty-five and thirty which would protect women from some advert events while delivering. These things might be main causes leading many families to have children when they are still young.

On the other hand, I strongly believe that a couple should have kids when they have enough financial conditions and mental health inspite of getting older. We cannot deny the importance of incomes and savings before having a new member in our family. If a couple has no stable jobs or very low-salaries, they should spend time developing their career and earning more money before becoming parents. Moreover, many persons do not prepare their spirits and consider how the life will change after a baby come which make them  confused, depressed and could not control themselves when their babies are born. As a result, the most important thing when we commit to have children is not our ages, but a sufficient preparation for everything.

In conclusion, despite some huge benefits of having babies early, it seems to me that we should prepare enough personal budgets and mental strength before welcoming our children."
"More people decided to have children in their later age than in the past. 
Do advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?","Nowadays, most individuals chose to have kids in their later age compared to what it used to be in the past. In my opinion, I believe it is more beneficial to have kids at later age than at young age because it makes one fully prepared for child care and also reduces the rate of over population.

On the one hand, there are many advantages of late child birth. Firstly, it enables one to be fully ready for the responsibilities that come with having children. This means that when people delay giving birth till their later age, by then they would have been well established financially, morally and education wise. The reality is that people who give birth early are not yet ready for the consequent duty of care. This difference can be seen when comparing  children education between the American and the Nigerian. Early child birth has made many Nigerian unable to afford their kids' education, whereas, the American which mostly give birth at later age have highest level of children education. It can, therefore, be logically deduced that giving birth at later life prepares one for the task of caring for them. Secondly, giving birth at later age helps to control population rate. If people start having kids at young age, they tend to have many kids before menopause, hence delaying child birth will help individual family to give birth to fewer children.

Despite the numerous benefits of giving birth at later life, it however, has some few drawbacks. First of it is the reduced chances of conception. Scientists have shown that the best chance of conception is between the age of 18 years to 28 years and the chances keep decreasing with age. This means that people who decide to wait till later age risk not having kids at all. Furthermore, delaying child birth could also result in certain complications during labour and delivery. For instance, conditions like miscarriage, early onset of labour and other complications, are associated with pregnancy at later life.

In conclusion, although, birthing children at later age has its merits and downsides, on the balance, I however believe the benefits surpass any drawbacks it may have."
"More people decided to have children in their later age than in the past. Why?

Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?","With a paradigm shift in social belief and people's fascination about having an enviable career, they tend to become parents at a later stage than the past. There are some prominent reasons for this and I personally believe that it has more negative consequences.

To begin with, the average year when people get married has increased than that of our ancestors. As a result, childbirth is naturally delayed. According to a recent survey, many young people who start their career after their graduation are more focused on their jobs than having their own family. Besides, a many young people are undecided whether to marry or not. Eventually, when they get married, they are already in their mid-thirties and they take some time to settle and have some financial stability before having their first child. Furthermore, the old belief that a girl should be prepared to manage a family and have children earlier has changed and more wives work in offices than ever. The decline of the joint family has also contributed to this trend as couples solely take the decision of having a baby, unlike the past.

If we notice the detrimental impacts of this trend has, we would surely try to reverse it. The most cynical outcome of this trend is the number of couples struggling to become parents. It is scientifically proved that infertility rate among couples is higher who try to become pregnant after mid-thirties. Some of the couples eventually break up their marriages due to this and it brings unfathomable social problems. Furthermore, having a child in the early years of marriage make the couple more family-oriented and this eventually help them have a better future.

To conclude, late marriage, nuclear family structure, and more focus on jobs are the main reasons people become parents at a later stage and this has undeniably more adverse results that the positive sides."
Many people think modern communication technology is having some negative effects on social relationship. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is irrefutable that globalized world has effected our life in numerous ways.It is a highly debated issue that latest technological development has deteriorated the communication among the family members.However, i believe that through telecommunication we are able to live in global village.

For connection, people use various social media channels to keep themseleves update about eache other life's. Some of the people opine that it has reduced the physical interaction and thus, has widened the gap among concrete relationship.However, this concept has been highly exaggerated.In reality, virtual communication has strengthened the bond among social relationship. To cite an example, if the people were not facilitated with the facebook, instagram and whatsapp communication medium, they would not have been connected with each other across the globe.

Despite of the fact in person communication cannot be compensated at the expense of the online communication, the technology has profound benefits on maintaining the social relationship. The various social media channels offer tremendous interest based groups which not only streamline latest content information but only does help in expanding the networking skills among the distant members.For example in United arab emirates, the Uae fusion group keep the family members informed about their daily life circumstances.

In conclusion, i reiterate that there are sufficient grounds to reject the view that social relationships might be jeopardized by the advent of advanced communication technologies. It is my genuine belief that as technology improves going forward, so will people's social experience."
"The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school, to what extent do you agree or disagree?","Sports are considered to be one of the most effective activities in children's lifestyle as they offer immense benefits to their health and also help in overall personality development. However, it is often discussed if sports are the best technique to introduce a child to a world where being cooperative is an essential part of regular survival in this competitive world. In my opinion, I fully agree that a school can be the best institution where children can be taught collaboration and teamwork by playing sports activities. 

Childhood is the most appropriate time when an individual learns life lessons. So, any skill learnt at the school level prepares a student to perform well in real-life situations in future. Talking about a sport like a football, it requires team efforts in order to goal of the counter-party due to which the whole team wins the game at the end. Also, the winning team is given a big trophy and some cash prize. This kind of game makes a child build team spirit as they all work towards the same goal and at the winning stage, they share the prizes between themselves. Such situations make a child more empathetic towards others and develop him to fight big challenges of life with good confidence. 

Another reason why playing sports in school is the best platform for young children to learn collaborative skills is that they often do not encounter situations at their house. Therefore, schools provide a space where kids meet multiple other children with different personalities and end up being friends as they exchange their thoughts and learn about each other's interests. This helps them to grow as a person. On the other hand, when these children compete with each other in the game, they show a team spirit yet play mutually and support one another which makes them realise how combined efforts in any situation can be beneficial.

In conclusion, it can be said that school sports play an important role in moulding child's nature and teach them critical skills which cannot be taught apart from them. A child learns the value of combined efforts and develops their sharing mindset which is quite less possible to be taught in the home-place other than in schools. Therefore, sports activities offered at educational places must be encouraged by the parents and school staff itself, considering the positive impact it does on the children."
The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In contemporary society, cooperation are foundation of working in the future as such many schools find that the best approach to teaching children to work together is playing team sports such as football, basketball, and volleyball. This essay will discuss both sides of the controversial issue, and my opinion will be provided.

To begin with, advocates of this proposition believe that learning how to play with a team is the best way to educate kids to cooperate. It is clear that joining activity play an important role in improving their skill such as how to plan games, solve  unpredictable situation, and  most significant  how to play together with teammates. Moreover, when they enjoy sports, it also can release stress or pressures, which increase the operation of their brain, for this reason, it brings about advantages when they join sports clubs  and also assists with their ability to cooperate.

On the other hand, despite many benefits, there are a number of negative aspects that cannot be ignored why the institutions not allow their youngsters to  play such as esports, which are online games? In other words, the fact that games can help their capacity, however, if they pay attention to them too much, it can cause a disadvantage for them such as a decrease in their score and lack of knowledge. As a result, it can lead to a drawback in education

In conclusion, playing sports that are a team can improve a number of their ability such as cooperation. In my view, they should manage their time while retaining their study."
The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In today’s educational landscape, many people are thinking about the impact of team sports at school for the children. While various methods exist, I strongly believe that this solution is the best way to cooperate teenagers between them. In this essay, I will discuss why I hold this view and provide two supporting reasons.

To begin with, company game provides self-discipline which teaches younger how to work collaboratively. It is one of the main keys for success, fostering crucial interpersonal skills. For instance, in a volleyball team, players must know and understand how to communicate with each other to provide their strategy for achieving goals. Consequently, the collaborative experience not only teaches infants the significant role of working together, but also helps them develop strong bonds with their teammates.

Secondly, children are exposed to both success and failure together, which has an essential impact on collective responsibility. When a team succeeds, each member shares in the victory, reinforcing the idea that cooperation leads to mutual benefits. For example, in moments of failure, kids learn to support and uplift one another, understanding that overcoming challenges requires collective effort. As a result, this shared experience contributes significantly to character development and prepares them for future collaborative endeavors.

In conclusion, team sports at school stand out as the most effective method for teaching infants cooperation. The structured environment, coupled with exposure to success and failure as a team, imparts invaluable life skills. By engaging in team sports, teenagers learn to collaborate effectively and develop a sense of collective responsibility that will serve them well in their future endeavors."
The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some people believe that the most effective way for children to learn how to cooperate with one another is to engage them in team sports at school. Personally, I completely agree with this idea and will outline several reasons why in the following essay.

Firstly, participating in team sports at school helps children to improve their communication skills, which are essential for effective cooperation. When children are engaged in team sports, whether it be basketball, football, or any other team sport that requires communication between the players, it is essential that they learn how to communicate with one another effectively in order to win the match. This can be achieved through verbal communication, body language, hand signals, or other forms of communication, and by regularly practising the many forms of communication involved in playing team sports, children are improving their ability to cooperate with one another simply through an improved ability to communicate.

Secondly, by taking part in team sports at school, children learn the effectiveness of working together in order to reach a common goal, which is the basis of cooperation. By playing team sports, children are forced to learn how to work together in order to win a match. In many team sports, training sessions focus on drills that train students how to execute certain strategies that require them to cooperate with one another, and by doing so, they get to experience the benefits of working together firsthand. If children do not have a good understanding of exactly how working together to reach a common goal is far more effective than working independently, then they will not have the desire or enthusiasm to cooperate with others. 

In conclusion, team sports help students improve their communication skills and allow them to experience first-hand the results of working together, which will then inspire and motivate them to cooperate better with others in the future"
"In many countries imprisonment is the most common solution to crimes. However, some people believe that better education will be a more effective solution. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","People have different views about whether or not sending law-breakers to prision is the common measurement to diminish level of crimes, while other people believe that education for criminals will be more significant solution. In my opinion, I completely agree that education for offender is the best way to tackle crimes. 

On the one hand, the primary reason for my belief education for criminals make significant contribution to reduce level of crimes. Fristly, since lack of education and poverty are the two main culprits for increased criminal activities, education for criminals enables them to seek better employment. This means that a form of education provides them with academic knowledge and soft skills through vocational traning, which enables them to escape the poverty traps and are less likely to commit a crime again after leaving prision. Secondly, education would instill a sense of value life and self-worth in criminals, and education would them to raise fully awaraness of dangers of their violating the laws and vulnerable victims. As a result, criminals could reduce the hatred of society and be remorseful for what they have done. 

On the other hand, another reason is that education about crimes at school is the effective solution to diminish level of crimes. The primary reason is that talking by ex-prisioners should be held at school in order to informed students of the threat of society and negative consequences when crime is commited. Moreover, ex-prisioners who have undergone long process of imprisionmemt and rehibiliation is great sources of real-life experience and the film harsh daily life of ex-prisioners with vivid imagery in incarceration. As a result, this acts a deterrent to people who have the intention to commit a crime, if they engage in criminal activities, they would receive sever punishment. 

In conclusion, I am convinced that promoting educational values is the best way to combat crimes from the root and increase public well-being"
"Some people think that public health within a country can be improved by government making laws regarding nutritious food. Others, however, think that health is a matter of personal choice and responsibility. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Personal and public health are tightly related to food choices. While some people believe that the government should regulate nutrition to improve public wellness, others argue that it should be people’s decision whether to pursue a healthy diet or not. This essay will discuss both points of view and explain why the authorities should not control the types of food people can buy.

Legislators could impose laws concerning nutritious food in an effort to have a healthier population, therefore, decreasing public health costs. Even if this could be considered a good idea, it would be very quite difficult to implement. To achieve this target, the rulers could impose a levy on unhealthy food options, or reduce their availability on the grocery stores shelves. In Italy, for example, products such as carbonated sugary drinks and chips are heavily taxed. As a result, the sales of these items have decreased. However, if the authorities start to take control of what their citizens can or cannot eat, it may be seen as limitation of freedom.

Since personal freedom is an extremely important human right, many people think that they should be responsible for their choices regarding the food and drinks they decide to consume. I agree with this opinion because limiting nutritional options, even if it is done with the best outcome in mind, could consequently create dissatisfaction among the population, which would possibly lead to other public issues such as protests and demonstrations. A better approach could be educating the public about a healthy diet, which would help people make better-informed decisions about the food they consume. Many developed countries around the world employed this strategy and saw public health gains.

In conclusion, even though the government is able to control the dietary habits of its population through taxation and restrictions, healthier citizens and reduced public health expenses isn’t the only possible outcome. Limiting personal freedom could result in social unrest and for that reason diet decisions are better to be left up to well-informed individuals."
23.Some people think the main purpose of schools is to turn the children into good citizens and workers rather than to benefit them as individuals. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Write an essay with no less than 250 words.,"Many parents argue harshly that schools are more likely to educate their children to become competent employees and law-abiding citizens who contribute to the country, rather than to think independently and critically about their own lives and aspirations. From my point of view, I strongly disagree with this perspective.

There are several reasons why I object to teaching students how to prioritize the training of various workers and residents. First of all, it is obvious that the diversity of abilities and knowledge that students receive at school provides them with more opportunities than they can obtain on their own, especially for some poor students. These include becoming exchange students to study abroad and participating in practice. Activities to enrich their experience. Secondly, the government strongly urges schools to pay more attention to colourful campus life and competitions in order to tap into the multifaceted potential of more students. In the end, I believe that  students can use the lessons taught as a springboard to learn more about the world. Especially in the fields of philosophy, mathematics, art, music, morality, and science.

On the other hand, educational institutions not only teach children how to acquire more knowledge but also provide excellent employees for the future development of the country and the government. However, it is undeniable that excessively forcing students to be good citizens may have adverse effects on society. A telling example is the general mental and physical problems that people can develop under the stress of overload. For instance, some college entrance examinations in many countries have caused countless students to stay up all night, eventually leading to death. Therefore, schools should prioritize the development of individuals and address the issue immediately.

To sum up, while some overcompetitive schools tend to produce students with excellent academic performance, it is important for authorities and schools to first develop students as independent individuals before teaching them all kinds of things."
"Some people think that the main purpose of school is to turn children as good citizens and workers, rather to benefit them as individuals. 
To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience","There is a saying that cultivating kids to be good residents or employees ought to be a priority in the background of the promotion of modern education, while others argue that individual interests are always the first consideration for such an issue. In this essay, l will explain why l agree with the former view, although we should still take into account other factors.

To begin with, at the heart of this matter is that the quality of the population will be improved aimed at general educational goal, which not only ensures the social stability but also enhances the cohesion of a nation. To be more specific, learning how to live in harmony with others is the first thing to meet the requirement of a good citizen for students based on a certain aim. Therefore, it is common to witness plenty of related group games played by minors in many public nursery schools, thus an awareness of teamwork could be built among these kids when they are too young to deal with different matters about this world. As a result, most of them tend to be great citizens after growing up in this general system, such as in Japan.

However, it is also unnecessary to weaken the property of the personal stake in the system of education, since they may lose the motivation to progress without private support. To exemplify, if a child makes a huge contribution but accepts nothing as a return in a tug-of-war, next time he will be less likely to participate in this activity again. By contrast, a young winner with rewards seems to behave better.

In conclusion, l believe that the national general education is supposed to be a key standard of schooling on the grounds that whole security of the society and unity, as long as certain individual benefits are got guaranteed to some extent."
Some people think that the main purpose of schools is to turn children into good citizens and workers.rather to benefit them as individuals. To what extent do you agree or disagree ?,"It is argued that, the principle goal of school is to make their students an appropriate resident and employee.This essay completely agrees with the given statement as these will   give benefit to the whole nation and the students become successful employee in the future.

First of all, during a schooling period, each and every pupil is being taught by their teachers to become a generous and a responsibility towards the country.If an adolescent do any wrong thing, an educator stops them and teach that how hazardous consequences happen due to this.For example, The London Times newspaper reveals that, 50% of students who grabbed moral values what they learned in school, are now a genuine citizen and achieve respective social status in the community due to their well being.Hence, by learning cultural values through the tutors, a person will give his determination for the amelioration of the nation.

Secondly, school grants up to the mark education to all the kids.Students who take this seriously would pursue a higher degree at the university due to their strong curriculum base in the school.Just then, by doing work with his intelligence, he will get all the success in his employment.In order to this, he could earn a good amount of money, which makes his life easy-going and luxurious.For instance, Delhi Public School stated that, their 30% of students, who was always cleared their exam with above 80% are now at the top post on their respective branch.

In conclusion, instead of teaching a beneficial skill to the pupil, I believe that the major focus of school to make their pupil a good resident of the country and a successful employee will  lead to fruitful consequences not only  for the whole nation but also for a children themselves."
"The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment.

What are the causes of this? 

What can be done to solve this problem?","In recent times, we have witnessed a significant surge in the production of consumer goods, a trend that has unfortunately contributed to the degradation of our natural world. This complex issue stems from a multitude of factors, and finding a solution requires a collective endeavor involving all stakeholders.

There exist several catalysts behind the expansion of the consumer industry and its subsequent negative impact on the environment. Chief among these is the rapid proliferation of consumerism. As the demand for goods escalates, the corresponding need for increased production becomes apparent. Consequently, industries engaged in manufacturing these goods have intensified their utilization of water, energy, and raw materials, resulting in the depletion of our precious natural resources. This challenge is further aggravated by inadequate environmental regulations that often fail to dissuade factories from releasing hazardous chemicals and toxic emissions into the surroundings.

Addressing these pressing environmental concerns necessitates collaborative actions from individuals, businesses, and governmental bodies. Firstly, it becomes imperative for governments to launch campaigns aimed at enhancing public awareness regarding the dire environmental consequences of rampant consumerism. Armed with a comprehensive understanding of these repercussions, individuals are more likely to embrace environmentally conscious behaviors, including refraining from excessive purchasing and transitioning to eco-friendly alternatives. This shift in consumer behavior, in turn, exerts pressure on companies and manufacturers to adopt more sustainable practices. Simultaneously, it is essential to bolster punitive measures against factories that disregard proper waste management, including longer business suspensions and legal repercussions for those responsible for such environmental transgressions. This two-pronged strategy holds promise for significantly mitigating the detrimental effects stemming from heightened consumer goods production on the environment.

In conclusion, the unchecked growth of consumerism, coupled with lenient environmental regulations, has paved the way for an expanding consumer industry that significantly impacts our environment. Nevertheless, this challenge can be effectively addressed through coordinated efforts from governments, citizens, and corporate entities."
Some people believe that what children watch on television influences their behavior. Others say that amount of time spent watching television influences their behavior,"Nowadays tv plays a major role in our life. It is  considered by  some people that types of a program can effect on kids behavior.While others believe that amount of time plays more role in their behavior.Before arriving at my position both the sides of arguments will be analyzed further.

        To begin with,why the  childern get attracted by charecters.To answer it, kids are unmature they do not know what is real and what it reel.They think everything is a real which they watch on the tv.For example,The survay revealed by America that after watching  Harry porter every kids get attached by this movie like eating same foods, wearing same cloths as well as dilogues.Another one is, if  pupil watch thriller film on a daily, it can effect on their a daily life.Regarding this they can get more aggressive and rude with the famliy along with friends .For instance,the data was cocluded by London that 70% of  kids are aggressive in recent time because of thriller film.

         On the other hand,some think a time can influence  them.It can be affected them due to if they watch the tv unlimited time it can harm their brain as well as a mental health.To explain it, the kids watch the televison for 5 hours without rest they will lost in the reel world  they think they are in movie.Also it can damage their eyes and heart they will not talk in proper way.For example,  cambridge university has found that if children see television more than five hour, will not behave like normal person.

     In conclusion, it is true that number of time period can damage the children in many way.I believe that the types of programs are more dangerous for them.these sireas or movies can make aggressive and rude them in normal life."
Some people think news has no connection to people’s lives. So then it is a waste of time to read the newspaper and watch television news programs. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In today’s society, people have various viewpoints on whether news has no correlation to people’s lives. Many believe that reading the newspaper and watching television news programs are meaningless as they are irrelevant to people’s daily routine.While I agree that news has no connection to human’s lives, I also believe that people should spend their time reading the newspapers and watching television news programs.

On the one hand, the argument that news is not connected to daily’s lives is reasonable, due to the fact that news these days is sometimes outdated and lacks  authenticity. In reality, there are yellow journalists who rely on profits instead of giving citizens access to meaningful stories. For instance, Vietnamese reporters usually make the hottest headlines about the death of some renowned celebrities namely Phuong My Chi, which leads to a focus of publicity and controversy. Therefore, viewers can be misunderstanding about the publicity that they are following and waste their time in the process.

Howere, I also think that people should spend time speculating  on the newspapers and watching television news programs. Firstly, news is appearing increasingly eye-catching and with informative content, rather than sensational news in the past.It is undeniable that news is the information and reports about the event that occurred in recent times, and they are categorized into various fields , so watching news means pondering specific fields of business. For example, while businesses can watch news to know what is happening with the economy, people who like sports can watch news about competitions in sports fields to relax. Moreover, during the Covid 19-pandemic, watching news can help people know more information about vaccine, diseases as soon as possible to protect their health.

In conclusion, while I agree that news has no correlation to people’s lives, I also believe that people should spend their time reading the newspaper and watching television news programs to gain more knowledge from this. Moreover, I suggest that publicers should make efforts to create more attention-grabbing and meaningful content to gain more readerships in the long term."
